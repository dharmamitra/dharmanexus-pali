If he so desired, Ānanda, the Tathāgata could remain for the life-span or for what remains of the life-span.’
['PA_mil_5.1.10:1.3']	Puna ca bhaṇitaṁ—	punar ca bhaṇita 	1	And again it was said:

['PA_mil_5.1.10:1.7']	Yadi, bhante, tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi bhante tathāgatena bhaṇita 	1	If, revered sir, this was said by the Tathāgata:

['PA_mil_5.1.10:1.11']	Ayampi ubhato koṭiko pañho gambhīro sunipuṇo dunnijjhāpayo tavānuppatto, bhindetaṁ diṭṭhijālaṁ, ekaṁse ṭhapaya, bhinda paravādan”ti.	ayam pi ubhatas koṭiko pañhaḥ gambhīraḥ su nipuṇaḥ dunnijjhāpayaḥ tava anuppattaḥ bhinda itam diṭṭhi jāle ekase ṭhapaya bhinda paravāda nti 	1	This double-pronged question has been put to you, profound and deep in meaning, hard to penetrate.

['PA_mil_5.1.10:2.2']	Na, mahārāja, bhagavā attano balaṁ kittayamāno evamāha, iddhibalaṁ pana, mahārāja, bhagavā parikittayamāno evamāha—	na mahā rāja bhagavā attanaḥ balam kittayamānaḥ evam āha iddhi balam pana mahā rāja bhagavā parikittayamānaḥ evam āha 	2	The Blessed One did not say this in order to boast of his own strength. He said it in order to proclaim the strength of his spiritual power.
['PA_mil_5.1.10:2.3']	‘tathāgatassa kho, ānanda, cattāro iddhipādā bhāvitā …pe… kappāvasesaṁ vā’ti.	tathāgatassa kho ānanda cattāro iddhipādāḥ bhāvitā pe kappa avasesam vāti 	2	‘The Tathagata has developed the four roads to power… and he could live for the remainder of the aeon.’

['PA_mil_5.1.10:3.3_0']	‘tathāgatassa kho, ānanda, cattāro iddhipādā bhāvitā bahulīkatā yānīkatā vatthukatā	tathāgatassa kho ānanda cattāro iddhipādāḥ bhāvitāḥ bahulīkatā yā anīka tā vatthukatā 	3	‘Ānanda, the Tathāgata has developed the four ways of attending to spiritual power and have made much of them, made them vehicles, made them bases, made them supports,

But the Blessed One does not demonstrate that spiritual power to that assembly,

['PA_mil_5.1.10:3.5']	Bhāsitampetaṁ, mahārāja, bhagavatā—	mahā rāja bhagavatā 	3	And this, great king, was said by the Blessed One:
