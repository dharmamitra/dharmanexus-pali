That which is preceding as object is a condition by way of object for the states that arise in the physical basis.

Therefore it is proper to say that all the consciousnesses beginning with adverting are each individually associated with their own states arisen at the same time as themselves, and that they apprehend the consciousnesses of another. And they do not become different from the states of consciousness by the name of ‘apprehending’, because the act of apprehending is not different. For adverting adverts only consciousness, and impulsion impels only consciousness. And all these are only consciousness. But beginning with the moment immediately following the past, the past aggregates are called ‘states of aggregates’, and the determinations such as the sign of the kasiṇa derived from the elements are called ‘determinations’.
