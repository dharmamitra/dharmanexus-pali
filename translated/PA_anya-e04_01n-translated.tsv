By this he shows that he reflects on the refuge in front of him. “What is not done he does not do” : the intention is that he is not able to do what is not done. Likewise, “what is done he does not do” . “Ugly” : ugly, unlovely. “Reprehensible” : blameworthy. Was not the arising of the mind previously stated to be reprehensible? But in the commentary the regret is stated to be reprehensible. Both are not in agreement. In order to show that they are not in disagreement, but are in agreement in a different way, he says “Herein, too” . “For what reason” : for the reason of the useless arising of the mind in regard to what is done and what is not done. That arising of the mind is suitable to be taken in the phrase “what is badly done” , not in the phrase “what is done and what is not done” , as in the case of the unprofitable and the unprofitable-indeterminate. The intention is that it is like the profitable and the profitable-indeterminate.

Because the root life-continuum, which is what is referred to by the words “of the non-root-causeless one,” is non-root-causeless. “Of the two non-root-causeless ones” is of the non-root-causeless ones of the unhappy destiny and of the non-root-causeless ones of the happy destiny. “Another opinion” is the other opinion stated in the Vibhaṅga. For this is said there: “Another opinion is that just as the object of non-root-causeless consciousness is with root-cause, so too the object of two- rooted and three-rooted consciousness is with root-cause.” And in accordance with that opinion, they say, the denial of the fruition associated with knowledge here is to be understood as referring to the non-root-causeless only. But that does not agree with the exposition in the “Treatise on the Analysis of States” . For there, in the section on the twelve profitable consciousnesses, it is said: “Herein, what is the profitable consciousness of the fine-material sphere? It is twofold: that with root-cause and that without root-cause” . And in the section on the ten profitable consciousnesses, it is said: “Herein, what is the profitable consciousness of the fine-material sphere? It is twofold: that with root-cause and that without root-cause” . Herein, in the case of the twelve profitable consciousnesses, the two kinds of consciousness without root-cause that are produced by kamma are excluded, and the four kinds of fruition associated with knowledge are excluded from the case of the two-rooted and root-causeless persons among the sixteen kinds of fruition of the profitable consciousness of the fine-material sphere.

So the path of the second type of person is tenfold according to the method of the second type of teacher.

That is why it is said, “There is no other reason apart from the non-consideration of that.” In the passage beginning, “The present and the past” , the meaning to be construed is this. The five-door adverting and the five-door impulsions that end in the registration that has that same object as its object. So too in the other instances. Even though the mindfulness is strong, it is still incomplete in the same way in the case of the series that ends in registration. “Because it is stated” : because it is stated in the Commentary. “In the earlier stage” : in the earlier stage of the five-door adverting and the five-door impulsions that end in registration. “By those” : by the objects of giving. “In that way” : in that matter.
