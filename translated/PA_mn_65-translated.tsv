['PA_mn_65:1.3']	Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi:	tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi 	1	There the Buddha addressed the monks: 
['PA_mn_65:1.4']	“bhikkhavo”ti.	bhikkhavaḥ ti 	1	“Monks!” 
['PA_mn_65:1.5']	“Bhadante”ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ.	bhadanta iti te bhikkhū bhagavataḥ 	1	“Venerable sir,” those monks replied. 
['PA_mn_65:1.6', 'PA_mn_65:2.1']	Bhagavā etadavoca:🔽“Ahaṁ kho, bhikkhave, ekāsanabhojanaṁ bhuñjāmi;	bhagavān etat avoca  aham kho bhikkhave eka āsana bhojanam bhuñjāmi 	1	The Buddha said this:

['PA_mn_65:3.1']	Evaṁ vutte, āyasmā bhaddāli bhagavantaṁ etadavoca:	evam vutte āyasmā bhaddāli bhagavantam etat avoca 	3	When this was said, Venerable Bhadāli said to the Buddha:
['PA_mn_65:3.2']	“ahaṁ kho, bhante, na ussahāmi ekāsanabhojanaṁ bhuñjituṁ;	aham kho bhante na ussahāmi eka āsana bhojanam bhuñjitu 	3	“I’m not able to eat only one meal a day.

['PA_mn_65:4.1']	“Tena hi tvaṁ, bhaddāli, yattha nimantito assasi tattha ekadesaṁ bhuñjitvā ekadesaṁ nīharitvāpi bhuñjeyyāsi.	tena hi tva bhaddāli yattha nimantitaḥ assasi tattha eka desam bhuñjitvā eka desam nīharitvā api bhuñjeyyāsi 	4	“Well then, Bhaddāli, you should eat one part there and take away one part.

['PA_mn_65:4.3']	“Evampi kho ahaṁ, bhante, na ussahāmi bhuñjituṁ;	evam pi kho aha bhante na ussahāmi bhuñjitu 	4	“I’m not able to do that either.

['PA_mn_65:4.6']	Atha kho āyasmā bhaddāli sabbaṁ taṁ temāsaṁ na bhagavato sammukhībhāvaṁ adāsi, yathā taṁ satthusāsane sikkhāya aparipūrakārī.	atha kho āyasman bhaddāli sabbam tam temāsam na bhagavato sammukhībhāvam adāsi yathā tam satthu sāsane sikkhāya a paripūra kārī 	4	And for the rest of that three-month period, Bhaddāli did not attend on the Buddha, as one who has not fulfilled the training attends on the Teacher.
['PA_mn_65:5.1']	Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā bhikkhū bhagavato cīvarakammaṁ karonti—	tena kho pana samayena sambahulāḥ bhikkhū bhagavataḥ cīvara kammam karonti 	5	At that time a number of monks were making a robe for the Buddha,

['PA_mn_65:6.2']	Sammodanīyaṁ kathaṁ sāraṇīyaṁ vītisāretvā ekamantaṁ nisīdi. Ekamantaṁ nisinnaṁ kho āyasmantaṁ bhaddāliṁ te bhikkhū etadavocuṁ:	sammodanīyam katham sāraṇīyam vītisāretvā ekamantam nisīdi ekamantam nisinnam kho āyasmantam bhaddālim te bhikkhū etat avocuḥ 	6	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down, and they told him what they were doing.
['PA_mn_65:6.3']	“idaṁ kho, āvuso bhaddāli, bhagavato cīvarakammaṁ karīyati.	idam kho āvuso bhaddāli bhagavataḥ cīvara kammam karīyati 	6	“This is the robe that we’re making for the Buddha.

['PA_mn_65:7.1_2']	bhaddāli bhagavantaṁ etadavoca:	bhaddāli bhagavantam etat avoca 	7	and said,
['PA_mn_65:7.2']	“accayo maṁ, bhante, accagamā yathābālaṁ yathāmūḷhaṁ yathāakusalaṁ, yohaṁ bhagavatā sikkhāpade paññāpiyamāne bhikkhusaṅghe sikkhaṁ samādiyamāne anussāhaṁ pavedesiṁ.	accayaḥ ma bhante accagamā yathābālam yathāmūḍham yathā akusala yā uham bhagavatā sikkhāpade paññāpiyamāne bhikkhu saṅghe sikkham samādiyamāne anussāham pavedesi 	7	“Venerable Sir, I’ve made a mistake.
