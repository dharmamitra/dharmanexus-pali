The tenth sutta, the Pavāraṇā Sutta, is explained in detail in the Commentary. The reason for the Buddha’s statement: “Ask whatever you wish while sitting in your own seat” is as follows. The bhikkhu, it seems, was a wanderer before his ordination. He had been used to asking questions of the ascetics and brahmins while sitting on a higher seat than theirs. He had not given up that habit even after his ordination. The Buddha, therefore, told him to ask his question while sitting in his own seat.
