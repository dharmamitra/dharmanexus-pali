Or else, by the words “six by six all round” he shows the six-six state of the three-three and so on. So the word samanta is a specification of the six-six modes of cross-linking with the three-three and so on, not a specification of the twenty-four. Consequently, taking the modes of cross-linking as twenty-four all round, he says “the twenty-four modes of cross-linking all round” . Or alternatively, the modes of cross-linking that occur all round by the three-three and so on, the six-six and so on, the direct-procedure and so on, the condition-procedure and so on, the root-cause and so on, the manifestation and so on, are called “modes of cross-linking all round” .

Or alternatively, he shows the analysis of states by states here too in the passage beginning with “It is a cause and a condition,” for the words “It is a cause and a condition” show the analysis of states by states. For the heading “It is a cause and a condition” is not an analysis of states by states as is the heading “Profitable, unprofitable, and neither-profitable-nor-unprofitable” . Rather, it is an analysis of the helpfulness of states.🔽Etassa means “of this.”
