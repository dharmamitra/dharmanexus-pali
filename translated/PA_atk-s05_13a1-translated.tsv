He was a scholar, a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; of clear delivery of words and syllables, a master of the sounds, padas, and analysis, a knower of the grammar of the Phagguna, Vassiṭṭha, and Kākatāriya schools, a master of the principles of right and wrong in the three Vedas, of the order of the words in the hymns, of the scansion of the metres, and of the meanings and phrasing of the sacrificial formulas. He was a teacher of the Three Vedas to five hundred brahmin youths. He was handsome, comely, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of complexion, with a fine head, a fine face, and a fine figure. He was virtuous, of good character, a doer of good deeds, a speaker of the truth, a regular alms-giver, a self-controlled observer of the moral law. He was beloved of, dear to, and popular with brahmins, householders, town-dwellers, country-folk, nobles, brahmins, merchants, workers, ascetics, and brahmin seers.
