For example, the Andhakas. The question “Does a disciple have knowledge of the fruit?” is put by one who holds the affirmative view, namely, the Sakavādins. The answer is given by one who holds the negative view, namely, the Andhakas. Then, in order to rebuke him, saying: “If a disciple has knowledge of the fruit, then just as the Buddhas, by the power of their knowledge, announce the classification of the fruit in the case of the fruit of stream-entry, which is the same for all, saying: ‘This one is a single-seed clan; this one is a clan with two seeds; this one is a clan with three seeds; this one is a clan with four seeds,’ so too, in your case, would a disciple also announce the classification of the fruit?”—he said: “A disciple announces the classification of the fruit.” The other rejects that.

Now there is the discussion of restraint. Herein, those who have attained power and mastery in the world would not be able to restrain another’s cognizance if they could not do so. What then is their power and mastery? But since they do restrain another’s cognizance by their power and mastery, so it is held by some, namely the Mahāsaṅghikas. The question “Does one person restrain another’s cognizance?” is put with the opinion of one’s own view, and the answer “Yes” is with the opinion of another’s view.

Herein, there are those who hold the view that “Another causes pleasure to arise in another” on the evidence of the sutta passage beginning, “The Blessed One has destroyed many kinds of pleasure for us” , like the proponents of the doctrine of “cause as self” . The question is put to them in order to expose their view, and the answer is given by the other party. When asked whether he causes pain to arise in another, he denies it, seeing no such sutta passage. In the case of the questions beginning with “his own pleasure” , what is one’s own or another’s cannot be caused to arise. What is not arisen cannot be caused to arise. That is why he denies. In the case of the questions beginning with “his own” , what is of that kind cannot be said to be non-arisen. That is why he admits it on the understanding that it is not so. But he does not admit the pleasure of the “No, friend” type because it does not exist.

Herein, according to the view of those who hold that “The Blessed One has destroyed many of the things that are a basis for pleasure for others” , as stated in the sutta passage beginning with the words, “Many are the things that are a basis for pleasure that the Blessed One has destroyed for me” , and who maintain that “One causes pleasure to arise in another,” the question is put in the affirmative, as in the case of the proponents of a cause, and the answer is in the negative, as in the case of the proponents of a self. But when asked whether he causes pain to arise, he denies it, since he does not see any such sutta passage. In the case of the questions beginning with “one’s own pleasure,” since it is impossible to cause one’s own or another’s pleasure to arise, he denies that it is possible to cause it to arise. In the case of the questions beginning with “one’s own,” he admits the proposition on the ground that what is of that kind cannot be called “arisen.” But he does not say that there is no such thing as the pleasure stated in the passage, “Many are the things that are a basis for pleasure that the Blessed One has destroyed for me.” The words “The Blessed One has destroyed many of the things that are a basis for pleasure” indicate that the Blessed One is a condition for the arising of pleasure in others.

The past should be understood as the past in the sense of the past designation of the aggregates. It is called the past because it is to be grasped by inference of past states that have been directly experienced. It is stated second because it is easier to understand than the future. The future should be understood as the future in the sense of the future designation of the aggregates. It is called the future because it is to be grasped by inference of states that have been directly experienced and grasped in the past in the sense that “such states will arise in the future.” It is stated third because it is easier to understand than the present.
