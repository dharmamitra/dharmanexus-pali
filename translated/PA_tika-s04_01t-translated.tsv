Purified, and knowers of the Vedas : they have gone to the other side of the Vedas, or they are gone to the other side by means of the Vedas. But here they are knowers of the Vedas because they have made all formed things clear to themselves by knowing them. Hence he said “all things.” They have made all things, that is, all aggregates, bases, and elements, clear to themselves by knowing them according to their specific characteristics and their general characteristics. They have crushed the heads of the three defilements, and they have attained supreme enlightenment, or they have gone beyond the round of rebirths, is the meaning. May they accept this homage from me: may those Blessed Ones accept this homage from me. And may they guard me: may those Blessed Ones, having been thus paid homage by me, guard me.
