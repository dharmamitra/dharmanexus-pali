For morality is the beginning of the Dispensation because all special qualities have morality as their foundation. That is why it is said: “Therefore, bhikkhu, purify first of all your own morality; when your morality is pure, purify understanding. What is the beginning of profitable things? Morality is the beginning of profitable things. Morality is the foundation of profitable things” . And that is why it is called the Chapter on Morality. But the Brahmajāla Sutta should be understood as the first sutta in the Sutta Piṭaka because it is the complete analysis of all views. For there is no sutta in the Buddha’s word that so thoroughly uproots and destroys the jungle of views as the Brahmajāla Sutta. The Nidāna Sutta was recited first at the First Council because it was asked for by the Elder Mahākassapa and was expounded by the venerable Ānanda in order to show the occasion, etc.,
