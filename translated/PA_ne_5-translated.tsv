Thus “Pain is his great fear” is the answer to the fourth question.
['PA_ne_5:15.13']	Tena ca catutthassa padassa visajjanā yuttā.	tena ca catutthassa padassa visajjanā yuttā 	15	And it is appropriate as the answer to the fourth question.

['PA_ne_5:19.1']	“Savatī”ti ca kho, bhikkhave, channetaṁ ajjhattikānaṁ āyatanānaṁ adhivacanaṁ.	savati iti ca kho bhikkhave channa itam ajjhattikānam āyatanānam adhivacana 	19	“Savatthi” is a term for the six internal sense-bases.
