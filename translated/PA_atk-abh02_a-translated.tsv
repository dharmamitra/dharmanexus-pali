For if it were to cause materiality to arise at the moment of its own arising or at the moment of its dissolution, then the rebirth-linking consciousness would also cause materiality to arise. But consciousness does not cause materiality to arise at these two moments. But just as a cobra’s hood, which is raised from the ground,🔽

For if the consciousness were to generate materiality at the moment of its presence or at the moment of its dissolution, then the rebirth-linking consciousness would also generate materiality. But consciousness does not generate materiality at those two moments. Just as a fan-palms seed, when it falls from the stalk, takes up soil with it and grows, so too the consciousness, at the moment of its arising, takes up the materiality that is the support and arises together with it. And at the moment of rebirth-linking the materiality that is the support is unable to be a condition as the support, and so the rebirth-linking consciousness does not generate materiality because of the deficiency of a condition.

For the proclamation of the characteristic of not-self is not within the province of anyone else; it is within the province of the all-knowing Buddhas alone. Thus this characteristic of not-self is not evident. Therefore the Exalted One, in revealing the characteristic of not-self, revealed it either through the characteristic of impermanence or through the characteristic of pain or through both the characteristics of impermanence and pain.
