But that is not so. ‘Born from Brahma’s mouth’: this is a mere assertion, a mere saying, a mere empty sound, a mere verbal expression, a mere verbal performance. Assalāyana, the wise, the learned, the discerning, do not accept that brahmans are the highest caste, that only they are pure, that only they are the sons of Brahma, born from his mouth, born of his parts, created by him, and heirs to his wealth.
