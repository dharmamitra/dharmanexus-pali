For in the case of the Tathāgata the flesh-folds that rise up from the right ear-hole cover the whole forehead, fill it out, and reach the left ear-hole, and they shine like a king’s top-knot turban. It seems that, having noticed this characteristic in future Buddhas, kings had top-knot turbans made for them. This is the first reason. Other people have incomplete heads. Some have concave heads, some fruit-shaped heads, some bone-shaped heads, some pot-shaped heads, some mountain-shaped heads. But the Tathāgata’s head is well-rounded, like a polished gem set on a stand. Herein, in the first way the head is described as “with a top-knot” because it is as if bound with a top-knot. In the second way it is described as “with a top-knot” because it is like a top-knot everywhere.
