['PA_mil_5.2.7:1.1']	“Bhante nāgasena, bhāsitampetaṁ bhagavatā—	bhante nāgasena bhāsitam petam bhagavatā 	“Though, revered Nāgasena, this was said by the Blessed One:

['PA_mil_5.2.7:1.4']	‘so anekasahassaṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharissati, seyyathāpi ahaṁ etarahi anekasataṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharāmī’ti.	saḥ aneka sahassam bhikkhu saṅgham pariharissati seyyathā api aham etarahi aneka satam bhikkhu saṅgham pariharāmi iti 	‘He will look after the community of monks numbering many thousands, just as I now look after the community of monks numbering many hundreds.’
['PA_mil_5.2.7:1.5']	Yadi, bhante nāgasena, bhagavatā bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi bhante nāgasena bhagavatā bhaṇita 	If, revered Nāgasena, this was said by the Blessed One:
['PA_mil_5.2.7:1.6_0']	‘tathāgatassa kho, ānanda, na evaṁ hoti “ahaṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharissāmī”ti vā,	tathāgatassa kho ānanda na evam hoti aham bhikkhu saṅgham pariharissāmi iti vā 	‘Ānanda, it does not occur to a Tathāgata that he will look after the community of monks or that the community of monks is dependent on him,’

['PA_mil_5.2.7:1.7']	Yadi tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi tathāgatena bhaṇita 	If the Tathāgata said this:
['PA_mil_5.2.7:1.8_0', 'PA_mil_5.2.7:1.8_1']	‘so anekasahassaṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharissati, seyyathāpi ahaṁ etarahi anekasataṁ🔽bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharāmī’ti, tena hi ‘tathāgatassa kho, ānanda, na evaṁ hoti “ahaṁ	saḥ aneka sahassam bhikkhu saṅgham pariharissati seyyathā api aham etarahi aneka sata  bhikkhu saṅgham pariharāmi iti tena hi tathāgatassa kho ānanda na evam hoti aha 	‘He will lead an Order of monks numbering several thousands, just as I do now an Order of monks numbering several hundreds,’ then this statement of yours is wrong,

['PA_mil_5.2.7:2.1']	“Bhāsitampetaṁ, mahārāja, bhagavatā ‘tathāgatassa kho, ānanda, na evaṁ hoti “ahaṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharissāmī”ti vā, “mamuddesiko bhikkhusaṅgho”ti vā’ti.	bhāsitam peta mahā rāja bhagavatā tathāgatassa kho ānanda na evam hoti aham bhikkhu saṅgham pariharissāmi iti vā mamuddesikaḥ bhikkhu saṅghaḥ iti vā ati 	“Great king, this was said by the Blessed One: ‘Ānanda, it does not occur to a Tathāgata: “I will lead an Order of monks” or “An Order of monks is to be led by me.”’

['PA_mil_5.2.7:2.3']	‘so anekasahassaṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharissati, seyyathāpi ahaṁ etarahi anekasataṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ pariharāmī’ti.	saḥ aneka sahassam bhikkhu saṅgham pariharissati seyyathā api aham etarahi aneka satam bhikkhu saṅgham pariharāmi iti 	‘He will lead an Order of monks numbering several thousands, just as I do now an Order of monks numbering several hundreds.’

The Tathāgata, sire, is free from
