Because the training rule is stated thus, “When the robe-cloth is finished.” He gets to keep it for ten days even after the robe season. But after the robe season he does not get to keep it even for a single day. How is it so? Just as, when the robe season is finished, the Sangha gets the benefits of the three robes from the day the robe season is finished until the end of the robe season, but not after that, so too, he gets to keep it for ten days from the day the robe season is finished until the end of the robe season. But after the robe season has been finished, he does not get to keep it even for a single day. Here it is said: “After the end of the robe season, he gets another ten days.” No. Why not? Because of the statement, “Monks, I allow you to keep an extra robe for ten days at the most.” Even during the robe season, at dawn on the eleventh day, it becomes subject to relinquishment.

But by way of their own form they are many. Therefore it is said: “The five kinds of valuable goods are spoken of by way of the king’s goods.” A pleasure park is a pleasure park for flowers or a pleasure park for fruits. A site for a pleasure park is a place that has been set aside and marked off for the sake of those very pleasure parks, or it is the old ground of those pleasure parks when they have been destroyed. A dwelling is any kind of building such as a stilt house. A site for a dwelling is the place on which it stands. A bed is one of the four kinds of beds mentioned above, namely, one of bamboo, one of wooden slabs, one with legs and framework and detachable bed slats, or one upholstered with cotton down. A bench is one of the four kinds of benches mentioned above, namely, one of bamboo, one of wooden slabs, one with legs and framework and detachable bench slats, or one upholstered with cotton down. A mattress is one of the five kinds of mattresses, namely, one of kusa grass, one of reeds, one of bark, one of cotton down, or one of wool. A pillow is one filled with one of the three kinds of cotton, namely, tree cotton, sunn hemp, or country willow, or with wool. A metal vessel is a bowl made of iron, copper, or bronze.
