['PA_mn_101:0.2']	Devadahasutta	devadahasutta 	0	The Gods’ Grove 
['PA_mn_101:1.1']	Evaṁ me sutaṁ—	evam me suta 	1	Thus have I heard. 
['PA_mn_101:1.2']	ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sakkesu viharati devadahaṁ nāma sakyānaṁ nigamo.	ekam samayam bhagavā sakkesu viharati devadaham nāma sakyānam nigamaḥ 	1	Once the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Devadaha. 
['PA_mn_101:1.3']	Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi:	tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi 	1	There the Buddha addressed the monks: 
['PA_mn_101:2.1']	“bhikkhavo”ti.	bhikkhavaḥ ti 	2	“Monks!” 
['PA_mn_101:2.2']	“Bhadante”ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ.	bhadanta iti te bhikkhū bhagavataḥ 	2	“Venerable sir,” those monks replied. 
['PA_mn_101:2.3']	Bhagavā etadavoca:	bhagavān etat avoca 	2	The Buddha said this: 
['PA_mn_101:2.4']	“santi, bhikkhave, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṁvādino evaṁdiṭṭhino:	santi bhikkhave eke samaṇa brāhmaṇāḥ eva vādinaḥ eva diṭṭhinaḥ 	2	“Monks, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
['PA_mn_101:2.5']	‘yaṁ kiñcāyaṁ purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā, sabbaṁ taṁ pubbekatahetu.	yam kiñca ayam purisa puggalaḥ paṭisavedeti sukham vā dukkham vā adukkham asukham vā sabbam tam pubbekata hetu 	2	‘Whatever a person experiences—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—all that is caused by what was done in the past.
['PA_mn_101:2.6']	Iti purāṇānaṁ kammānaṁ tapasā byantībhāvā, navānaṁ kammānaṁ akaraṇā, āyatiṁ anavassavo;	iti purāṇānam kammānam tapasā byantībhāvāḥ navānam kammānam akaraṇāḥ āyatim anavassavaḥ 	2	Thus by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions, the tendency to action will be severed.
['PA_mn_101:2.7']	āyatiṁ anavassavā kammakkhayo; kammakkhayā dukkhakkhayo; dukkhakkhayā vedanākkhayo; vedanākkhayā sabbaṁ dukkhaṁ nijjiṇṇaṁ bhavissatī’ti.	āyatim anavassavā kamma kkhayaḥ kamma kkhayā dukkha kkhayaḥ dukkha kkhayā vedanā kkhayaḥ vedanā kkhayā sabbam dukkham nijjiṇṇam bhavissati iti 	2	With the severing of the tendency to action, there is the termination of action. With the termination of action, there is the termination of suffering. With the termination of suffering, all suffering is terminated.’
['PA_mn_101:2.8']	Evaṁvādino, bhikkhave, nigaṇṭhā.	eva vādinaḥ bhikkhave nigaṇṭhāḥ 	2	This is the doctrine of the Jains.
['PA_mn_101:3.1']	Evaṁvādāhaṁ, bhikkhave, nigaṇṭhe upasaṅkamitvā evaṁ vadāmi:	evavādā āha bhikkhave nigaṇṭhe upasaṅkamitvā evam vadāmi 	3	I go up to them and say:
['PA_mn_101:3.2']	‘saccaṁ kira tumhe, āvuso nigaṇṭhā, evaṁvādino evaṁdiṭṭhino—	saccam kira tumhe āvuso nigaṇṭhāḥ eva vādinaḥ eva diṭṭhinaḥ 	3	‘Is it true, friends, that you say this and hold this view:
['PA_mn_101:3.3']	yaṁ kiñcāyaṁ purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā, sabbaṁ taṁ pubbekatahetu.	yam kiñca ayam purisa puggalaḥ paṭisavedeti sukham vā dukkham vā adukkham asukham vā sabbam tam pubbekata hetu 	3	“Whatever a person experiences is caused by what was done in the past.
['PA_mn_101:3.4']	Iti purāṇānaṁ kammānaṁ tapasā byantībhāvā, navānaṁ kammānaṁ akaraṇā, āyatiṁ anavassavo;	iti purāṇānam kammānam tapasā byantībhāvāḥ navānam kammānam akaraṇāḥ āyatim anavassavaḥ 	3	So by destroying old actions through asceticism, and by doing nothing new, there will be no consequence in the future.
['PA_mn_101:3.5']	āyatiṁ anavassavā kammakkhayo; kammakkhayā dukkhakkhayo; dukkhakkhayā vedanākkhayo; vedanākkhayā sabbaṁ dukkhaṁ nijjiṇṇaṁ bhavissatī’ti?	āyatim anavassavā kamma kkhayaḥ kamma kkhayā dukkha kkhayaḥ dukkha kkhayā vedanā kkhayaḥ vedanā kkhayā sabbam dukkham nijjiṇṇam bhavissati iti 	3	With no consequence in the future, action will be exhausted. With the exhaustion of action, there will be the exhaustion of suffering. With the exhaustion of suffering, there will be the exhaustion of feeling. With the exhaustion of feeling, all suffering will be exhausted”?’🔽When I say this, they agree, saying:
['PA_mn_101:3.6']	Te ca me, bhikkhave, nigaṇṭhā evaṁ puṭṭhā ‘āmā’ti paṭijānanti.	te ca me bhikkhave nigaṇṭhāḥ evam puṭṭhāḥ āma iti paṭijānanti 	3	‘Yes.
