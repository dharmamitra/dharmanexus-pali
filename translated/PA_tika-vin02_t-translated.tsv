But it is a reason for the True Dhamma’s duration for five hundred years from the time when the going forth of women took place. For the Blessed One would not have allowed the going forth of women if the True Dhamma would have lasted only four hundred years. And the Elder Mahā Kassapa would not have asked for it if it were to disappear in a century’s time. So it should be understood that this is a reason for the duration of the True Dhamma for five hundred years from the time when the going forth of women took place.🔽As to “the Arahants who have attained the discriminations”: this is a reason for the duration of the True Dhamma for five hundred years only. For the True Dhamma would not have disappeared if it had lasted longer than that even with the Arahants who have attained the discriminations.
