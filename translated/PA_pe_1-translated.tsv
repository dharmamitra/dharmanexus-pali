['PA_pe_1:141.5']	Tassa dve nissayā—	tassa dve nissayā 	141	It has two bases:

There is no suffering that is not bodily or mental. All suffering can be demonstrated as twofold, bodily and mental.🔽It is included in the three kinds of suffering, as suffering due to pain, as suffering due to change, and as suffering due to defilement.
['PA_pe_1:141.9']	Iti taṁ sabbaṁ dukkhaṁ tīhi dukkhatāhi saṅgahitaṁ.	iti tam sabbam dukkham tīhi dukkha tāhi saṅgahita 	141	So all that suffering is included in the three kinds of suffering.
['PA_pe_1:141.10']	Iti idañca dukkhaṁ tividhaṁ.	iti idam ca dukkham 	141	So this suffering is threefold.
['PA_pe_1:141.11', 'PA_pe_1:141.12']	Duvidhaṁ dukkhaṁ kāyikañca cetasikañca.🔽Duvidhaṁ appiyasampayogo ca piyavippayogo ca.	duvidham dukkham kāyikañca cetasikañca  duvidhaṃ appiya sampayogo ca piya vippayogo ca 	141	There are two kinds of suffering, bodily and mental.
['PA_pe_1:141.13']	Idaṁ sattavidhaṁ dukkhaṁ.	idam sattavidham dukkha 	141	There are two kinds of suffering, association with what is not liked and dissociation from what is liked.🔽This is the sevenfold suffering.
['PA_pe_1:142.1']	Tattha tividho samudayo acatuttho apañcamo.	tattha tividhaḥ samudayaḥ a catutthaḥ a pañcamaḥ 	142	Herein, the three kinds of origin are without a fourth and without a fifth.
['PA_pe_1:142.2']	Katamo tividho?	katamaḥ tividhaḥ 	142	What are the three kinds?
['PA_pe_1:142.3', 'PA_pe_1:142.4']	Taṇhā ca diṭṭhi ca kammaṁ.🔽Tattha taṇhā ca bhavasamudayo kammaṁ.	taṇhā ca diṭṭhi ca kamma  tattha taṇhā ca bhava samudayo kamma 	142	Craving, view, and action.🔽Herein, craving is the origin of being, and action is the origin of the rest.
['PA_pe_1:142.5']	Tathā nibbattassa hīnapaṇītatā, ayaṁ samudayo.	tathā nibbattassa hīna paṇīta tā ayam samudayaḥ 	142	And the inferiority and superiority of what is generated in this way is the origin.

['PA_pe_1:142.6_2']	sopi tīhi dukkhatāhi saṅgahito.	saḥ api tīhi dukkha tāhi saṅgahitaḥ 	142	are also included in the three kinds of suffering.
['PA_pe_1:143.1']	Tathā vipallāsato diṭṭhi āgantabbā.	tathā vipallāsataḥ diṭṭhi āgantabbā 	143	Similarly, view should be brought in as perversion.
['PA_pe_1:143.2']	Sā sattavidhā niddisitabbā.	sā sattavidhā niddisitabbā 	143	It should be demonstrated as sevenfold.
['PA_pe_1:143.3']	Eko vipallāso tīṇi niddisīyati, cattāri vipallāsavatthūni.	ekaḥ vipallāso tīṇi niddisīyati cattāri vipallāsa vatthūni 	143	One perversion is demonstrated as three, and the four grounds for perversion.
['PA_pe_1:143.4']	Tattha katamo eko vipallāso?	tattha katamaḥ ekaḥ vipallāso 	143	Herein, what is the one perversion?

['PA_pe_1:143.6']	Evaṁ cattāro vipallāsā.	evam cattāraḥ vipallāsā 	143	So there are four perversions.
['PA_pe_1:143.7']	Ayameko vipallāsīyati saññā cittaṁ diṭṭhi.	ayam ekaḥ vipallāsīyati saññā cittam diṭṭhi 	143	This is one perversion of perception, cognizance, and view.
['PA_pe_1:143.8']	Katamāni cattāri vipallāsavatthūni?	katamāni cattāri vipallāsa vatthūni 	143	What are the four grounds for perversions?
['PA_pe_1:143.9', 'PA_pe_1:143.10']	Kāyo vedanā cittaṁ dhammā.🔽Evaṁ vipallāsagatassa akusalañca pavaḍḍheti.	kāyaḥ vedanā cittam dhammā  evam vipallāsa gatassa akusalam ca pavaḍḍheti 	143	They are the body, feelings, cognizance, and ideas.🔽So when one has gone into perversion, then the unprofitable increases.

['PA_pe_1:143.13']	Diṭṭhivipallāso mohaṁ akusalamūlaṁ pavaḍḍheti.	diṭṭhi vipallāsaḥ moham akusala mūlam pavaḍḍheti 	143	The perversion of view increases the unprofitable root delusion.
['PA_pe_1:143.14']	Tattha dosassa akusalamūlassa tīṇi micchattāni phalaṁ—	tattha dosassa akusala mūlassa tīṇi micchattāni 	143	Herein, the three wrongnesses are the fruit of the unprofitable root hate, namely
['PA_pe_1:143.15']	micchāvācā micchākammanto micchāājīvo;	micchā vācā micchā kammanto micchā ājīvo 	143	wrong speech, wrong action, and wrong livelihood.

['PA_pe_1:143.18']	mohassa akusalamūlassa dve micchattāni phalaṁ—	mohassa akusala mūlassa dve micchattāni 	143	The two wrongnesses are the fruit of the unprofitable root delusion, namely
['PA_pe_1:143.19']	micchādiṭṭhi ca micchāsati ca.	micchādiṭṭhi ca micchāsati ca 	143	wrong view and wrong mindfulness.
['PA_pe_1:143.20']	Evaṁ akusalaṁ sahetu sappaccayaṁ vipallāsā ca paccayo, akusalamūlāni sahetū eteyeva paṭipakkhena anūnā anadhikā dvīhi paccayehi niddisitabbā.	evam akusalam sa hetu sappaccayam vipallāsā ca paccayaḥ akusala mūlāni sa hetū ete yeva paṭipakkhena anūnā anadhikā dvīhi paccayehi niddisitabbā 	143	So the unprofitable has a cause and a condition in the perversions, and the roots of the unprofitable have a cause and are these same with the opposite attribution. They should be demonstrated by the two conditions without addition or omission.
['PA_pe_1:143.21']	Nirodhe ca magge ca vipallāsamupādāya parato paṭipakkhena catasso.	nirodhe ca magge ca vipallāsam upādāya paratas paṭipakkhena catasso 	143	And in the case of cessation and the path, the perversions are the opposite with the addition of the two conditions.
