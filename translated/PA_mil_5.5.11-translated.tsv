['PA_mil_5.5.11:0.4']	11. Ācariyānācariyapañha	    	The Questions of the Teacher and the Non-Teacher
['PA_mil_5.5.11:1.1']	“Bhante nāgasena, bhāsitampetaṁ bhagavatā—	bhante nāgasena bhāsitam petam bhagavatā 	“Though, revered Nāgasena, this was said by the Blessed One:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.1']	‘Na me ācariyo atthi,	na me ācariyaḥ atthi 	‘I have no teacher,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.2']	sadiso me na vijjati;	sadisaḥ me na vijjati 	there is none like me,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.3']	Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ,	sa devakasmin 	in the world with its gods,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.4']	natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti.	natthi me paṭipuggalo ti 	there is no one equal to me.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.1']	Puna ca bhaṇitaṁ—	punar ca bhaṇita 	And again it is said:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.2']	‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesi, uḷārāya ca maṁ pūjāya pūjesī’ti.	iti kho bhikkhave āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi uḷārāya ca mam pūjāya pūjesi iti 	‘Thus, monks, Āḷāra Kālāma, my teacher, while being my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on the same level as himself, and honoured me with great honour.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.3']	Yadi, bhante nāgasena, tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi bhante nāgasena tathāgatena bhaṇita 	If, revered Nāgasena, this was said by the Tathāgata:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.4', 'PA_mil_5.5.11:3.5_0']	‘na me ācariyo atthi, sadiso me na vijjati.🔽Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ, natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti, tena hi ‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro	na me ācariyaḥ atthi sadisaḥ me na vijjati  sa devakasmiṃ lokasmi natthi me paṭipuggalo ti tena hi iti kho bhikkhave āḷāro 	‘I have no teacher, there is none like me.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.5_1']	kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesī’ti yaṁ vacanaṁ, taṁ micchā.	kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi iti yam tam micchā 	In the world with its gods, there is no one equal to me,’ then the statement that ‘Thus, monks, Āḷāra Kālāma, my teacher, while being my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on the same level as himself,’ is wrong.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.6']	Yadi tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi tathāgatena bhaṇita 	If this was said by the Tathāgata:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.7', 'PA_mil_5.5.11:3.8']	‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesī’ti, tena hi ‘na me ācariyo atthi, sadiso me na vijjati.🔽Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ, natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti tampi vacanaṁ micchā.	iti kho bhikkhave āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi iti tena hi na me ācariyaḥ atthi sadisaḥ me na vijjati  sa devakasmiṃ lokasmi natthi me paṭipuggalo ti tat pi vacanam micchā 	‘I have no teacher, there is no one like me.🔽In the world with its gods and men,🔽there is no one who is my equal.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.9']	Ayampi ubhato koṭiko pañho tavānuppatto, so tayā nibbāhitabbo”ti.	ayam pi ubhatas koṭikaḥ pañho tava anuppatto saḥ tayā nibbāhitabbaḥ ti 	“This too is a double-pronged question, profound, hard to penetrate and leading to another, which you have put to me. You must unravel it yourself.”
['PA_mil_5.5.11:4.1']	“Bhāsitampetaṁ, mahārāja, tathāgatena	mahā rāja tathāgatena 	“Great king, the Tathāgata has said:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.1']	‘Na me ācariyo atthi,	na me ācariyaḥ atthi 	‘I have no teacher,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.2']	sadiso me na vijjati;	sadisaḥ me na vijjati 	there is no one like me.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.3']	Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ,	sa devakasmin 	In the world with its gods and men,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.4']	natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti.	natthi me paṭipuggalo ti 	there is no one who is my equal.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:6.1']	Bhaṇitañca—	bhaṇitam ca 	And he has also said:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:6.2']	‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesi, uḷārāya ca maṁ pūjāya pūjesī’ti.	iti kho bhikkhave āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi uḷārāya ca mam pūjāya pūjesi iti 	‘Āḷāra Kālāma, my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on the same level as himself, and he honoured me with the highest honour.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:7.1']	Tañca pana vacanaṁ pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ācariyabhāvaṁ sandhāya bhāsitaṁ.	tat ca pana vacanam pubbā iva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa iva sato ācariya bhāvam sandhāya bhāsita 	But this statement was made by the Tathāgata with reference to his state as a teacher before he was fully enlightened.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.1']	Pañcime, mahārāja, pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa sato ācariyā, yehi anusiṭṭho bodhisatto tattha tattha divasaṁ vītināmesi.	pañcime mahā rāja pubbā iva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa sataḥ ācariyāḥ yehi anusiṭṭhaḥ bodhisatto tattha tattha divasam vītināmesi 	“Great king, there were five teachers of the Bodhisatta before he attained enlightenment.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.2']	Katame pañca?	katame pañca 	What were the five?
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.3']	Ye te, mahārāja, aṭṭha brāhmaṇā jātamatte bodhisatte lakkhaṇāni pariggaṇhiṁsu, seyyathidaṁ—	ye te mahā rāja aṭṭha brāhmaṇāḥ jāta matte bodhisatte lakkhaṇāni pariggaṇhisu 	“Great king, there were eight brahmins who, as soon as the Bodhisatta was born, examined his marks, namely:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.4']	rāmo dhajo lakkhaṇo mantī yañño suyāmo subhojo sudattoti.	rāmaḥ dhajaḥ lakkhaṇaḥ mantī yañño suyāmaḥ subhojaḥ sudatto ti 	Rāma, Dhajo, Lakkhaṇa, Manti, Yaggi, Suyāma, Subhajo, and Sudatta.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.5']	Te tassa sotthiṁ pavedayitvā rakkhākammaṁ akaṁsu, te ca paṭhamaṁ ācariyā.	te tassa sotthim pavedayitvā rakkhā kammam te ca paṭhamam ācariyā 	They announced his safety and performed the rite of protection. They were his first teachers.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:9.1_0']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, bodhisattassa pitā suddhodano rājā yaṁ tena samayena abhijātaṁ	puna capara mahā rāja bodhisattassa pitā suddhodanaḥ rājā yam tena samayena abhijāta 	“Furthermore, great king, the Bodhisatta’s father, King Suddhodana, brought to him🔽a brahmin named Sabbamitta, who was of high birth,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:9.1_1']	udiccajātimantaṁ padakaṁ veyyākaraṇaṁ chaḷaṅgavantaṁ sabbamittaṁ nāma brāhmaṇaṁ upanetvā	udicca jātimantam padakam veyyākaraṇam chaḷaṅgavantam sabbamittam nāma brāhmaṇam upanetvā 	of a pure lineage, a master of the three Vedas, with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and skilled in philology and grammar.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:9.1_2']	sovaṇṇena bhiṅgārena udakaṁ oṇojetvā ‘imaṁ kumāraṁ sikkhāpehī’ti adāsi, ayaṁ dutiyo ācariyo.	sovaṇṇena bhiṅgārena udakam oṇojetvā imam kumāram sikkhāpehi iti adāsi ayam dutiyaḥ ācariyo 	Having poured water from a golden jar over the Bodhisatta’s head, he said: ‘Teach this prince.’ He was the second teacher.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:10.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, yā sā devatā bodhisattaṁ saṁvejesi, yassā vacanaṁ sutvā bodhisatto saṁviggo ubbiggo tasmiṁyeva khaṇe nekkhammaṁ nikkhamitvā pabbaji, ayaṁ tatiyo ācariyo.	puna capara mahā rāja yā sā devatā bodhisattam savejesi yassāḥ vacanam sutvā bodhisatto saviggaḥ ubbiggaḥ tasmiya eva khaṇe nekkhammam nikkhamitvā pabbaji ayam tatiyaḥ ācariyo 	“Again, sire, that deity who stirred the Bodhisatta to emotion, on hearing whose words the Bodhisatta was stirred and agitated and on that very occasion went forth from home into homelessness, this was his third teacher.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:11.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, āḷāro kālāmo ākiñcaññāyatanassa parikammaṁ ācikkhi, ayaṁ catuttho ācariyo.	puna capara mahā rāja āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ākiñcaññāyatanassa parikammaṃ ācikkhi ayam catutthaḥ ācariyo 	“Again, sire, Āḷāra Kālāma taught him the preliminary exercise for the sphere of nothingness, this was his fourth teacher.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:12.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, udako rāmaputto nevasaññānāsaññāyatanassa parikammaṁ ācikkhi, ayaṁ pañcamo ācariyo.	puna capara mahā rāja udakaḥ rāmaputto nevasaññānāsaññāyatanassa parikammam ācikkhi ayam pañcamaḥ ācariyo 	“Again, sire, Udaka Rāmaputta taught him the preliminary exercise for the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, this was his fifth teacher.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:13.1']	Ime kho, mahārāja, pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa sato pañca ācariyā.	ime kho mahā rāja pubbā iva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa sato pañca ācariyāḥ 	These, sire, were the five teachers of the Bodhisatta before he awakened to full enlightenment.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:13.2']	Te ca pana ācariyā lokiye dhamme.	te ca pana ācariyāḥ lokiye dhamme 	And these teachers were in the field of worldly things.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:13.3_0']	Imasmiñca pana, mahārāja, lokuttare dhamme sabbaññutañāṇappaṭivedhāya natthi tathāgatassa	imasmin ca pana mahā rāja lokuttare dhamme sabbaññuta ñāṇa ppaṭivedhāya na atthi tathāgatassa 	And in this, sire, which is the supramundane field, the knowledge of omniscience, there is no preceptor for the Tathāgata.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:13.3_1']	anuttaro anusāsako, sayambhū, mahārāja, tathāgato anācariyako, tasmā kāraṇā tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	anuttaraḥ anusāsakaḥ sayambhu mahā rāja tathāgataḥ tasmā kāraṇā tathāgatena bhaṇita 	The Tathāgata, sire, is self-dependent, he has no preceptor, he is the Enlightened One, the Teacher, the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming. For this reason it was said by the Tathāgata:🔽“The Tathāgata, sire, is the foremost, the best, the pre-eminent, the supreme, the highest, the incomparable one among those who have attained enlightenment.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:14.1']	‘Na me ācariyo atthi,	na me ācariyaḥ atthi 	‘I have no teacher,
