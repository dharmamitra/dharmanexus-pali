Herein, one who has come down in a good family, as it is said: “Now on that occasion a kulaputta named Ratthapala, the son of a leading clan in that same Thullakotthita” , is called a kulaputta by birth. But one who has come down in any kind of family at all, as it is said: “Those kulaputtas who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith” , is called a kulaputta by conduct. But here a kulaputta by conduct is intended. Hence he said: “A kulaputta is a kulaputta by conduct” . “Fit” : suitable, worthy of being spoken to thus, is the meaning.
