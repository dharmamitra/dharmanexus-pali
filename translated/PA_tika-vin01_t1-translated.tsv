A reed bed is here called a “naḷa” . Therefore it is called a naḷeru because it grew in a reed bed, and it is a pucimanda tree, thus it is called a naḷerupucimanda . Or alternatively, it is a naḷeru because it grew in a reed forest. It seems that this tree grew in a reed forest. It is a pucimanda tree with a large reed hollow, thus it is called a naḷerupucimanda .

But after doing the preliminary work in this way, when he has emerged from the fourth jhāna, which is the basis for direct-knowledge, and has given attention to the kamma and its result as impermanent, etc., then the adverting that has that kamma and its result as object occurs next to the emergence from the fourth jhāna.
