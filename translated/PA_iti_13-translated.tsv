['PA_iti_13:1.1']	Vuttañhetaṁ bhagavatā vuttamarahatāti me sutaṁ:	vuttam ha etam bhagavatā vuttam arahatā iti me suta 	1	This was said by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, so I have heard:
['PA_iti_13:2.1']	“Makkhaṁ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṁ aparijānaṁ tattha cittaṁ avirājayaṁ appajahaṁ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya.	bhikkhave an abhijānam a parijānam tattha cittam a virājayam a pajaham abhabbaḥ dukkha kkhayāya 	2	“Monks, without directly knowing and fully understanding contempt, without making it disappear and relinquishing it, one is incapable of destroying suffering.

['PA_iti_13:3.2']	sattā gacchanti duggatiṁ;	sattāḥ gacchanti duggati 	3	to a bad destination,
['PA_iti_13:3.3']	Taṁ makkhaṁ sammadaññāya,	tam makkham sammat aññāya 	3	having fully understood that contempt,
