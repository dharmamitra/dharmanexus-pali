Herein, the motion is what is called “doing of a legal act.” The “doing” is the determining at the time of determining of that motion. The “consent” is the doing of the legal act by oneself; the meaning is, the doing of the legal act by oneself. The “acquiescence” is the acquiescing by one who is asked; the meaning is, the acquiescing by one who is asked thus, “Do this legal act.” The “non-objection” is the non-objection by one who is told; the meaning is, the non-objection by one who is told thus, “I agree to this. Let the Community do the legal act.” The “non-reproach” is the non-reproach by one who is reminded; the meaning is, the non-reproach by one who is reminded thus, “I do not agree to this.
