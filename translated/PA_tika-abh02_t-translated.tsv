The word “rebirth-linking” is formed in the way stated in the sense of “giving rebirth-linking” by the addition of the suffix -aka, which has the characteristic of denoting “diversity” or “distinction” . Herein, the kamma that is conascent with the rebirth-linking consciousness gives rebirth-linking, and the kamma that is not conascent with it but is a condition for it by way of decisive support gives rebirth-linking by causing the occurrence of rebirth-linking. Both kinds of kamma cause rebirth-linking by producing rebirth in the various kinds of becoming again and again. That is why it is said, “It is the giver of rebirth-linking, too” , and so on. It is only the kamma that gives rebirth-linking that is called “rebirth-linking” because it is similar to the result, that is, rebirth-linking, and because it is the cause of it. So it is called “rebirth-linking” in the way that a tree is called a “mango” because it is similar to the mango fruit and is the cause of it. The kamma that does not give rebirth-linking is not called “rebirth-linking” in this way. Herein, kamma that is to be experienced in the present becomes kamma that is to be experienced here since it is kamma that is to be experienced in this becoming.

For in the case of “With mentality-materiality as condition, ignorance” , all the four aggregates are called “mentality-materiality” as conditions for ignorance. The intention here may be this: the conditionality of the particular kinds of mentality, namely, the sixth sense sphere, etc., by ignorance should be stated, and so the methods in terms of the sixth sense sphere, etc., are stated. But just that mentality which is a condition for ignorance is also called “with becoming as condition” in the case of “With becoming as condition, ignorance” . So there is no difference to be stated.
