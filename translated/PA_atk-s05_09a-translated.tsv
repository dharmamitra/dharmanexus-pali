It seems that in his days as a layman he did his own pestle-pounding because of poverty, so he says this. ‘He has no shame’ means ‘My husband has no shame, no embarrassment, so he is not to my liking.’ This is the remainder of the words.🔽‘I am disgusted with the conduct of those who are infatuated with sensual pleasures’ means that she is disgusted with the conduct of those who are infatuated with sensual pleasures because her mind is naturally detached from sensual pleasures.

It seems that in his poverty he used to pound grain himself even in his lay life, and so he says ‘from the pestle.’ ‘My husband is shameless’: my husband is shameless, without a sense of shame. ‘He does not please me’: this is the remainder of the sentence. Because she is naturally free from lust, she speaks with disgust at the behaviour of those who are lustful. ‘Even a well or a tank’: the meaning is, even a well or a tank dug for the sake of life does not please me.
