['PA_iti_7:1.1']	Vuttañhetaṁ bhagavatā vuttamarahatāti me sutaṁ:	vuttam ha etam bhagavatā vuttam arahatā iti me suta 	1	This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:
['PA_iti_7:2.1']	“Sabbaṁ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṁ aparijānaṁ tattha cittaṁ avirājayaṁ appajahaṁ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya.	bhikkhave an abhijānam a parijānam tattha cittam a virājayam a pajaham abhabbaḥ dukkha kkhayāya 	2	“Monks, without directly knowing and fully understanding all, without making it fade away and letting go of it, one is not able to make an end of suffering.
['PA_iti_7:2.2']	Sabbañca kho, bhikkhave, abhijānaṁ parijānaṁ tattha cittaṁ virājayaṁ pajahaṁ bhabbo dukkhakkhayāyā”ti.	sabbañca kho bhikkhave abhijānam parijānam tattha cittam virājayam pajaham bhabbaḥ dukkha kkhayāya ati 	2	But by directly knowing and fully understanding all, by making it fade away and letting go of it, one is able to make an end of suffering.”
['PA_iti_7:2.3']	Etamatthaṁ bhagavā avoca.	etam attham bhagavān avoca 	2	The Blessed One said this.
['PA_iti_7:2.4']	Tatthetaṁ iti vuccati:	tattha itam iti vuccati 	2	And in connection with this, it was said:
['PA_iti_7:3.1']	“Yo sabbaṁ sabbato ñatvā,	yaḥ sabbam sabbatas ñatvā 	3	“Having known all as all,
['PA_iti_7:3.2']	sabbatthesu na rajjati;	sabbatthesu na rajjati 	3	he is not tied to any of the all.
['PA_iti_7:3.3']	Sa ve sabbapariññā so,	sa ve sabba pariññā saḥ 	3	He has fully understood all,
['PA_iti_7:3.4', 'PA_iti_7:4.1']	sabbadukkhamupaccagā”ti.🔽Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti.	sabba dukkham upaccagāti  ayam pi atthaḥ vuttaḥ bhagavatā iti me sutam ti 	3	and has gone beyond all suffering.”
['PA_iti_7:4.2']	Sattamaṁ.	sattama 	4	This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So it was with reference to this that it was said by the Blessed One: “The ending of all is the way to the Beyond.”🔽The seventh section on the ending of all is finished.
