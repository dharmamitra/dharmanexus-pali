One day he saw a Kinnarī, and became enamored of her. “I will make her my wife,” said he, and without so much as asking leave of Asitābhū, he followed the Kinnarī. The Kinnarī, seeing him following her, said to him, “I am a Kinnarī, and you are a human being. We are not of the same species. Do not follow me.” But he paid no attention to her words, and continued to follow her. The Kinnarī, seeing that he was determined to follow her, took him to her home, which was a beautiful city. There she gave him a house to live in, and provided him with food and clothing.

But as soon as he had gone outside the house, he found himself in the Himalayas, in the same place where he had been before.
