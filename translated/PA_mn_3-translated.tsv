['PA_mn_3:1.3']	Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi:	tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi 	1	There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:
['PA_mn_3:1.4']	“bhikkhavo”ti.	bhikkhavaḥ ti 	1	“Bhikkhus!”
['PA_mn_3:1.5']	“Bhadante”ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ.	bhadanta iti te bhikkhū bhagavataḥ 	1	“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied.
['PA_mn_3:1.6']	Bhagavā etadavoca:	bhagavān etat avoca 	1	The Blessed One said this:
['PA_mn_3:2.1']	“Dhammadāyādā me, bhikkhave, bhavatha, mā āmisadāyādā.	dhamma dāyādāḥ me bhikkhave bhavatha mā āmisa dāyādā 	2	“Bhikkhus, be my heirs in the Dhamma, not my heirs in material things.
['PA_mn_3:2.2']	Atthi me tumhesu anukampā:	atthi me tumhesu anukampā 	2	I have compassion for you,

['PA_mn_3:2.6']	ahampi tena ādiyo bhaveyyaṁ:	aham pi tena ādiyaḥ 	2	And I too would blame myself thus:

['PA_mn_3:2.10']	ahampi tena na ādiyo bhaveyyaṁ:	aham pi tena naḥ ādiyaḥ 	2	Nor should I be reproached:

['PA_mn_3:2.13']	Atthi me tumhesu anukampā:	atthi me tumhesu anukampā 	2	I have compassion for you, thinking:

['PA_mn_3:3.3']	Atha dve bhikkhū āgaccheyyuṁ jighacchādubbalyaparetā.	atha dve bhikkhū āgaccheyyum jighacchā dubbalya paretā 	3	And two monks came looking for food,
['PA_mn_3:3.4']	Tyāhaṁ evaṁ vadeyyaṁ:	tyā aham evam vadeyya 	3	I would say to them:
['PA_mn_3:3.5']	‘ahaṁ khomhi, bhikkhave, bhuttāvī pavārito paripuṇṇo pariyosito suhito yāvadattho;	aham kho amhi bhikkhave bhuttāvī pavāritaḥ paripuṇṇaḥ pariyositaḥ su hitaḥ yāvadattho 	3	‘I have eaten and refused more food.

If you don’t eat it, I’ll either throw it away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water without living beings.’
['PA_mn_3:3.8', 'PA_mn_3:3.9']	Tatrekassa bhikkhuno evamassa:🔽‘bhagavā kho bhuttāvī pavārito paripuṇṇo pariyosito suhito yāvadattho;	tatra ekassa bhikkhuno evam assa  bhagavā kho bhuttāvī pavāritaḥ paripuṇṇaḥ pariyositaḥ suhitaḥ yāvadattho 	3	One of the monks thought,🔽‘The Buddha has eaten and refused an invitation to eat more.

['PA_mn_3:3.12']	Vuttaṁ kho panetaṁ bhagavatā:	vuttam kho pana itam bhagavatā 	3	But the Buddha has said,
['PA_mn_3:3.13']	“dhammadāyādā me, bhikkhave, bhavatha, mā āmisadāyādā”ti.	dhamma dāyādāḥ me bhikkhave bhavatha mā āmisa dāyādā ati 	3	“Monks, be heirs of my teachings, not heirs of my material things.”
['PA_mn_3:3.14']	Āmisaññataraṁ kho panetaṁ, yadidaṁ piṇḍapāto.	āmi saññataram kho pana ita yat idam piṇḍapātaḥ 	3	And this almsfood is the most material thing there is.
['PA_mn_3:3.15']	Yannūnāhaṁ imaṁ piṇḍapātaṁ abhuñjitvā imināva jighacchādubbalyena evaṁ imaṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyyan’ti.	yat nūna aham imam piṇḍapātam a bhuñjitvā iminā ava jighacchā dubbalyena evam imam rattindivam 	3	Why don’t I spend this night and day with hunger and weakness, without eating this almsfood?’
['PA_mn_3:3.16']	So taṁ piṇḍapātaṁ abhuñjitvā teneva jighacchādubbalyena evaṁ taṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyya.	saḥ tam piṇḍapātam a bhuñjitvā tena iva jighacchā dubbalyena evam tam rattindivam 	3	He would spend the night hungry and weak.
['PA_mn_3:3.17']	Atha dutiyassa bhikkhuno evamassa:	atha dutiyassa bhikkhuno evamassa 	3	Then the second monk would think,
['PA_mn_3:3.18']	‘bhagavā kho bhuttāvī pavārito paripuṇṇo pariyosito suhito yāvadattho;	bhagavā kho bhuttāvī pavāritaḥ paripuṇṇaḥ pariyositaḥ suhitaḥ yāvadattho 	3	‘The Buddha has eaten, refused an invitation to eat more, and declined a further offer.

['PA_mn_3:3.20', 'PA_mn_3:3.21']	Sace mayaṁ na bhuñjissāma, idāni bhagavā appaharite vā chaḍḍessati, appāṇake vā udake opilāpessati.🔽Yannūnāhaṁ imaṁ piṇḍapātaṁ bhuñjitvā jighacchādubbalyaṁ paṭivinodetvā evaṁ imaṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyyan’ti.	sace mayam na bhuñjissāma idāni bhagavā appaharite vā chaḍḍessati appāṇake vā udake opilāpessati  yat nūna aham imam piṇḍapātam bhuñjitvā jighacchā dubbalyam evam imam rattindivam 	3	If we don’t eat it, the Buddha will throw it away on a place with no grass or drop it in water without moving creatures.🔽Why don’t I eat this almsfood and then spend the night hungry and weak?’
['PA_mn_3:3.22']	So taṁ piṇḍapātaṁ bhuñjitvā jighacchādubbalyaṁ paṭivinodetvā evaṁ taṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyya.	saḥ tam piṇḍapātam bhuñjitvā jighacchā dubbalyam evam tam rattindivam 	3	He would eat that almsfood and then spend the night hungry and weak.
['PA_mn_3:3.23_0']	Kiñcāpi so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu taṁ piṇḍapātaṁ bhuñjitvā jighacchādubbalyaṁ paṭivinodetvā	kiñca api saḥ bhikkhave bhikkhu tam piṇḍapātam bhuñjitvā jighacchā dubbalyam paṭivinodetvā 	3	Even though that monk would eat that almsfood and then spend the night hungry and weak,

['PA_mn_3:3.24']	Taṁ kissa hetu?	tam kim sa hetu 	3	Why is that?
['PA_mn_3:3.25']	Tañhi tassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno dīgharattaṁ appicchatāya santuṭṭhiyā sallekhāya subharatāya vīriyārambhāya saṁvattissati.	tat hi tassa bhikkhave bhikkhunaḥ dīgharattam appiccha tāya santuṭṭhiyā sallekhāya subhara tāya vīriya ārambhāya savattissati 	3	Because that monk’s long-term welfare and happiness depend on fewness of wishes, contentment, solitude, aloofness, and persistence.
['PA_mn_3:3.26']	Tasmātiha me, bhikkhave, dhammadāyādā bhavatha, mā āmisadāyādā.	tasmā ati ha me bhikkhave dhamma dāyādāḥ bhavatha mā āmisa dāyādāḥ 	3	Therefore, monks, be heirs of my teachings, not heirs of my material things.
['PA_mn_3:3.27']	Atthi me tumhesu anukampā:	atthi me tumhesu anukampā 	3	I have compassion for you, thinking:

['PA_mn_3:4.1']	Idamavoca bhagavā.	idam avoca bhagavān 	4	That is what the Buddha said.
['PA_mn_3:4.2']	Idaṁ vatvāna sugato uṭṭhāyāsanā vihāraṁ pāvisi.	idam vatvāna sugataḥ uṭṭhāya āsanā vihāram pāvisi 	4	Having said that, the one with supernormal powers, the Well-gone One, got up from his seat and went into his dwelling.
['PA_mn_3:4.3']	Tatra kho āyasmā sāriputto acirapakkantassa bhagavato bhikkhū āmantesi:	tatra kho āyasmā sāriputtaḥ acira pakkantassa bhagavataḥ bhikkhū āmantesi 	4	Soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the monks,
['PA_mn_3:4.4']	“āvuso bhikkhave”ti.	āvuso bhikkhave ti 	4	“Venerables, monks!”
['PA_mn_3:4.5']	“Āvuso”ti kho te bhikkhū āyasmato sāriputtassa paccassosuṁ.	āvuso ti kho te bhikkhū āyasmato sāriputtassa 	4	“Venerable,” they replied.
['PA_mn_3:4.6']	Āyasmā sāriputto etadavoca:	āyasmā sāriputtaḥ etat avoca 	4	Sāriputta said,
