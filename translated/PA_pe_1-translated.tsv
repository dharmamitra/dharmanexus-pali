['PA_pe_1:143.6']	Evaṁ cattāro vipallāsā.	evam cattāraḥ vipallāsā 	So there are four perversions.
['PA_pe_1:143.7']	Ayameko vipallāsīyati saññā cittaṁ diṭṭhi.	ayam ekaḥ vipallāsīyati saññā cittam diṭṭhi 	This is one perversion of perception, cognizance, and view.

['PA_pe_1:143.13']	Diṭṭhivipallāso mohaṁ akusalamūlaṁ pavaḍḍheti.	diṭṭhi vipallāsaḥ moham akusala mūlam pavaḍḍheti 	The perversion of view increases the unprofitable root delusion.
['PA_pe_1:143.14']	Tattha dosassa akusalamūlassa tīṇi micchattāni phalaṁ—	tattha dosassa akusala mūlassa tīṇi micchattāni 	Herein, the three wrongnesses are the fruit of the unprofitable root hate, namely
['PA_pe_1:143.15']	micchāvācā micchākammanto micchāājīvo;	micchā vācā micchā kammanto micchā ājīvo 	wrong speech, wrong action, and wrong livelihood.

['PA_pe_1:143.18']	mohassa akusalamūlassa dve micchattāni phalaṁ—	mohassa akusala mūlassa dve micchattāni 	The two wrongnesses are the fruit of the unprofitable root delusion, namely
['PA_pe_1:143.19']	micchādiṭṭhi ca micchāsati ca.	micchādiṭṭhi ca micchāsati ca 	wrong view and wrong mindfulness.
['PA_pe_1:143.20']	Evaṁ akusalaṁ sahetu sappaccayaṁ vipallāsā ca paccayo, akusalamūlāni sahetū eteyeva paṭipakkhena anūnā anadhikā dvīhi paccayehi niddisitabbā.	evam akusalam sa hetu sappaccayam vipallāsā ca paccayaḥ akusala mūlāni sa hetū ete yeva paṭipakkhena anūnā anadhikā dvīhi paccayehi niddisitabbā 	So the unprofitable has a cause and a condition in the perversions, and the roots of the unprofitable have a cause and are these same with the opposite attribution. They should be demonstrated by the two conditions without addition or omission.
['PA_pe_1:143.21']	Nirodhe ca magge ca vipallāsamupādāya parato paṭipakkhena catasso.	nirodhe ca magge ca vipallāsam upādāya paratas paṭipakkhena catasso 	And in the case of cessation and the path, the perversions are the opposite with the addition of the two conditions.
