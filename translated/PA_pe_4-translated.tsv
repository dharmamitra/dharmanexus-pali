['PA_pe_4:2.2']	Kiṁ nu kho idaṁ suttaṁ ārabhi …pe… tehi suttehi saha adhisannaṭṭhehi yujjati udāhu na yujjatīti?	kim nu kho idam suttam ārabhi pe tehi suttehi saha adhisanna ṭṭhehi yujjati udāhu na yujjati iti 	Does this sutta begin with what? … and so on up to … does it agree with the Suttas and with the Discipline?
['PA_pe_4:3.1']	Yathā bhagavā kilese ādimhi tattha deseti.	yathā bhagavā kilese ādimhi tattha deseti 	As the Blessed One teaches in the case of defilements, so in the case of the origin of the world.
['PA_pe_4:3.2']	Kiṁ desitaṁ?	kim 	What is taught?
['PA_pe_4:3.3']	Tesaṁ kilesānaṁ pahānaṁ udāhu no desitanti upaparikkhitabbaṁ.	tesam kilesānam pahānam udāhu no desitanti upaparikkhitabba 	The abandoning of those defilements. Or is it not taught? It should be investigated.
['PA_pe_4:3.4']	Yadi na desitaṁ bhagavati tesaṁ kilesānaṁ pahānaṁ kusalā dhammā pariyesitabbā;	yadi na desitam bhagavati tesam kilesānam pahānam kusalāḥ dhammā pariyesitabbā 	If the Blessed One’s teaching of the abandoning of those defilements is not found, then profitable ideas should be sought out
['PA_pe_4:3.5']	yattha te akusalā pahānaṁ gacchanti.	yattha te akusalā pahānam gacchanti 	where those unprofitable ideas are abandoned.
['PA_pe_4:3.6']	Sace samannehamāno na labhati.	sace samannehamānaḥ na labhati 	If, on reviewing, he does not find it,
['PA_pe_4:3.7']	Tattha akusalā dhammā apakaḍḍhitabbā vīmaṁsitabbā, saṅkilesabhāgiyasuttaṁ, yadi kilesā apakaḍḍhiyantā.	tattha akusalāḥ dhammāḥ apakaḍḍhitabbāḥ vīmasitabbā saṅkilesabhāgiya sutta yadi kilesāḥ apakaḍḍhiyantā 	then those unprofitable ideas should be removed and investigated in the sutta dealing with corruption, and if those defilements are removed,
['PA_pe_4:3.8']	Ye vā na denti tattha upaparikkhitabbā ariyamaggadhammā tāsu bhūmīsu kilesā pahānaṁ gacchanti, udāhu na gacchantīti.	ye vā na denti tattha upaparikkhitabbāḥ ariya magga dhammā tāsu bhūmīsu kilesāḥ pahānam gacchanti udāhu na gacchanti iti 	Or else, if they do not give, they should be examined thus: “Are the defilements in these stages abandoned by the noble path or not? ”
['PA_pe_4:3.9']	Yattakā pana kilesā desitā.	yattakā pana kilesāḥ desitā 	But how many defilements are taught?
['PA_pe_4:3.10']	Na tattakā ariyadhammā desitā.	na tattakāḥ ariya dhammāḥ desitā 	And how many noble ideas are taught?
['PA_pe_4:3.11']	Yattha kilesā pahānaṁ gacchanti, tattha ye kilesā ariyadhammānaṁ paṭipakkhena na yujjanti, te apakaḍḍhitabbā, sace apakaḍḍhiyantā yojanaṁ deti.	yattha kilesā pahānam gacchanti tattha ye kilesāḥ ariya dhammānam paṭipakkhena na yujjanti te apakaḍḍhitabbā sace apakaḍḍhiyantā yojanam deti 	And where the defilements are abandoned, there the defilements that are not opposed to the noble ideas should be excluded if they give a reason.
['PA_pe_4:3.12']	Tattha evaṁ vīmaṁsitabbaṁ.	tattha evam 	Herein, this should be investigated:
['PA_pe_4:3.13']	Dve tīṇi vā taduttari vā kilesā ekena ariyamaggena pahānaṁ gacchantīti.	dve tīṇi vā tad uttari vā kilesāḥ ekena ariya maggena pahānam gacchanti iti 	whether two, three, or more than that, defilements are abandoned by a single noble path.
['PA_pe_4:3.14']	Sace evaṁ vīmaṁsiyantā yojanaṁ deti, tattha upaparikkhitabbaṁ.	sace evam yojanam deti tattha upaparikkhitabba 	If they give a reason when investigated in this way, then this should be examined:
['PA_pe_4:3.15']	Paramparāya vā piṭakasampadānena vā suttassa attho ca nattho ca.	paramparāya vā piṭaka sampadānena vā suttassa attho ca nattho ca 	whether by tradition or by the text’s arrangement, the meaning of the sutta is or is not.
['PA_pe_4:3.16']	Yaṁ vā na sakkā suttaṁ niddisituṁ neva suttaṁ vicikicchitabbaṁ.	yam vā na sakkā suttam niddisitum na iva suttam 	Or if it is not possible to demonstrate a sutta, then the sutta need not be doubted.
['PA_pe_4:3.17']	Evaṁ yathā ādimhi kusalā dhammā honti.	evam yathā ādimhi kusalāḥ dhammāḥ honti 	So firstly, when the ideas are profitable,
['PA_pe_4:3.18']	Ye kilesā te pahīneyyāti.	ye kilesā te pahīneyya ati 	the defilements should be abandoned.
['PA_pe_4:3.19']	Te upaparikkhitabbā.	te upaparikkhitabbā 	They should be examined.
['PA_pe_4:3.20']	Puro vā kusalo paṭipakkhena vā puro desanā, anūnā anadhikā uggahetabbā.	puras vā kusalaḥ paṭipakkhena vā puras desanā anūnā anadhikā uggahetabbā 	Or else, if the teacher is skilled, he can teach by way of the opposite. The teaching should be received neither less nor more than is appropriate.
['PA_pe_4:3.21']	Yathā paṭhamo uttilo yesamidāni kilesānaṁ ye ariyadhammā desitā ime kilesā imehi ariyadhammehi pahīyanti, udāhu nappahīyantīti vicinitabbā.	yathā paṭhamaḥ uttilaḥ yesam idāni kilesānam ye ariya dhammāḥ desitāḥ ime kilesāḥ imehi ariya dhammehi pahīyanti udāhu na pahīyanti iti vicinitabbā 	The first kind of questioning is that of the kind: “Now, which of these defilements are taught by the Noble Ones as being abandoned by which of the Noble Ones’ states? Are they abandoned or not?”
['PA_pe_4:3.22']	Yadi upaparikkhiyamānā yujjanti, gahetabbā.	yadi upaparikkhiyamānā yujjanti gahetabbā 	If, on examination, they are found to be abandoned, they should be accepted.
['PA_pe_4:3.23']	Atha na yujjanti, ye kilesā apaṭipakkhā honti, te kilesā aparipakkhitabbā.	atha na yujjanti ye kilesāḥ apaṭipakkhāḥ honti te kilesāḥ a paripakkhitabbā 	But if they are not found to be abandoned, then those defilements that are not opposed should not be examined.
['PA_pe_4:3.24']	Ye ca ariyadhammā paṭipakkhā honti, te ariyadhammā apakaḍḍhitabbā.	ye ca ariya dhammā paṭipakkhāḥ honti te ariya dhammā apakaḍḍhitabbā 	And those Noble Ones’ states that are not opposed should be rejected.
['PA_pe_4:3.25']	Na hi ariyadhammā anāgāmikilesappahānaṁ gacchanti, nāpi ariyadhammā sabbakilesānaṁ pahānāya saṁvattanti.	na hi ariya dhammā anāgāmi kilesa ppahānam gacchanti na api ariya dhammā sabba kilesānam pahānāya savattanti 	For the Noble Ones’ states do not lead to the abandoning of the defilements that are not opposed to them, nor do they lead to the abandoning of all defilements.
['PA_pe_4:3.26']	Yathā kusalā mettā akusalo rāgo na tu kusalā mettāti kāretvā akusalassa rāgassa pahānāya sambhavati byāpādo mettāya pahānaṁ gacchati.	yathā kusalā mettā akusalaḥ rāgaḥ na tu kusalā mettā ati kāretvā akusalassa rāgassa pahānāya sambhavati byāpādaḥ mettāya pahānam gacchati 	For example, the unprofitable greed is not abandoned by the profitable loving-kindness, which is opposed to the unprofitable hate, since it is not opposed to greed.
['PA_pe_4:3.27']	Tasmā ubho kilesā upaparikkhitabbā.	tasmai ubho kilesā upaparikkhitabbā 	So both kinds of defilement should be examined.
['PA_pe_4:3.28', 'PA_pe_4:3.29']	Yo yo ca dhammo upadisiyati kusalo vā akusalo vā so apakaḍḍhitabbo.🔽Sace te yujjanti apakaḍḍhiyamāno natthi upaparikkhitabbaṁ.	yaḥ yaḥ ca dhammaḥ upadisiyati kusalaḥ vā akusalaḥ vā saḥ apakaḍḍhitabbo  sace te yujjanti apakaḍḍhiyamāno natthi 	And whatever profitable or unprofitable state is taught, that should be weeded out.🔽If it is found to be consistent when it is weeded out, it should be investigated further.
['PA_pe_4:3.30']	Dve vā kilesā ekena ariyadhammena pahīneyyāti dvīhi vā ariyadhammehi eko vā kileso pahīyatīti.	dve vā kilesā ekena ariya dhammena pahīneyyāti dvīhi vā ariya dhammehi ekaḥ vā kileso pahīyati iti 	Either two defilements are given up by one noble idea or one defilement is given up by two noble ideas.
['PA_pe_4:4.1']	Atha vā evampi upaparikkhiyamānaṁ yujjati, tattha vīmaṁsitabbaṁ vā yathā yujjati tattha vīmaṁsitabbaṁ vā, yathā nanu sakkā suttaṁ niddisituṁ, na hi sutte vicikicchitabbaṁ.	atha vā evam pi upaparikkhiyamānam yujjati tattha vīmasitabbam vā yathā yujjati tattha vīmasitabbam vā yathā nanu sakkā suttam niddisitu na hi sutte vicikicchitabba 	Or else, if it is found to be consistent when investigated thus, it should be investigated further as to how it is consistent. Or else, if it is found not to be consistent when investigated thus, it should be investigated further as to how it is not consistent. For it is possible to demonstrate a Thread, and one must not doubt a Thread.
['PA_pe_4:4.2']	Kileso maṁ ariyadhammesu desitesu ubhayato upaparikkhitabbaṁ.	kilesaḥ mam ariya dhammesu desitesu ubhayatas 	When the defilements are demonstrated and the noble ideas are demonstrated, it should be investigated from both ends thus:🔽“Now, are these defilements given up by these noble ideas or are they not?
['PA_pe_4:4.3', 'PA_pe_4:4.4']	Kira ye vā ime kilesā desitā ye ca ariyadhammā desitā gāthāya vā byākaraṇena vā, kiṁ nu kho ime kilesā imehi ariyadhammehi pahīyanti, udāhu nappahīyanti?🔽Ime vā ariyadhammā imesaṁ kilesānaṁ pahānāya saṁvattantīti.	kira ye vā ime kilesāḥ desitāḥ ye ca ariya dhammāḥ desitāḥ gāthāya vā byākaraṇena vā kim nu kho ime kilesāḥ imehi ariya dhammehi pahīyanti udāhu na pahīyanti 🔽ime vai ariya dhammā imesam kilesānam pahānāya savattanti iti 	Or do these noble ideas lead to the giving up of these defilements?”
['PA_pe_4:4.5']	Kiñcāpi kusalehi dhammehi akusalā dhammā pahānaṁ gacchanti.	kiñca api kusalehi dhammehi akusalāḥ dhammāḥ pahānam gacchanti 	And although unwholesome states are abandoned by means of wholesome states,
['PA_pe_4:4.6']	Na tu sabbehi ariyadhammehi sabbākusalā pahānaṁ gacchanti.	na tu sabbehi ariya dhammehi sabba akusalāḥ pahānam gacchanti 	nevertheless all unwholesome states are not abandoned by all the noble states.
['PA_pe_4:4.7']	Yathā mettā kusalo akusalo ca rāgo na tu kusalā mettā akusalo rāgoti kāretvā mettāya rāgo pahānaṁ, byāpādo mettāya pahānaṁ gacchanti.	yathā mettā kusalaḥ akusalaḥ ca rāgaḥ na tu kusalāḥ mettā akusalaḥ rāgaḥ iti kāretvā mettāya byāpādaḥ mettāya pahānam gacchanti 	Just as, although loving-kindness is a wholesome state and lust is an unwholesome state, nevertheless lust is not abandoned by means of the wholesome state of loving-kindness, but only by the abandoning of lust itself and by means of loving-kindness as the state of opposition to ill will.
['PA_pe_4:4.8', 'PA_pe_4:4.9']	Evaṁ kilesoti kāretvā suttena pahānaṁ gacchati.🔽Na sutto dhammoti kāretvā sabbaṁ kilesassa pahānāya saṁvattati.	evam kileso ti kāretvā suttena pahānam gacchati  na suttaḥ dhammaḥ ti kāretvā sabbam kilesassa pahānāya savattati 	So too, although defilements are abandoned by means of the Thread,🔽nevertheless all defilements are not abandoned by all Threads, but only by the abandoning of the defilements themselves and by means of the Thread as the state of opposition to the defilements.
['PA_pe_4:4.10']	Yaṁ tu suttassa ariyadhammo saṅkilesapaṭipakkho, so tena pahānaṁ gacchatīti.	yam tu suttassa ariya dhammo saṅkilesa paṭipakkho so tena pahānam gacchati iti 	But the noble states taught in the Thread that is taught as the opposition to the defilements are abandoned by means of that Thread.
['PA_pe_4:5.1']	Tattha kusale desite sutte byākaraṇe vā saṅkilesā na yujjanti ariyadhammā vā, te mahāpadese niddisitabbāvayavena apakaḍḍhitabbā.	tattha kusale desite sutte byākaraṇe vā saṅkilesāḥ na yujjanti ariya dhammāḥ vā te mahā apadese niddisitabba avayavena apakaḍḍhitabbā 	Herein, if the defilements are not appropriate to the Thread or to the exegesis taught, then the noble states taught in the Thread or in the exegesis are to be demonstrated by means of the part of the Thread that is demonstrated.
['PA_pe_4:5.2']	Tattha kilesehi ca desitehi ariyadhammesu ca yadipi tena ariyadhammena te kilesā pahānaṁ gacchanti.	tattha kilesehi ca desitehi ariya dhammesu ca yadi pi tena ariya dhammena te kilesāḥ pahānam gacchanti 	Herein, although the defilements taught in the Thread and the noble states taught in the Thread are abandoned by means of that Thread,
['PA_pe_4:5.3']	Tatthapi uttari upaparikkhitabbaṁ.	tattha api uttari 	Herein, there is more to be said.
['PA_pe_4:5.4']	Kena kāraṇena ete kilesā pajahitabbā, kena kāraṇena ariyadhammā desitāti?	kena kāraṇena ete kilesā pajahitabbā kena kāraṇena ariya dhammā desitā ati 	Why are these defilements to be abandoned, and why are the Noble Ones’ ideas taught?

['PA_pe_4:5.6', 'PA_pe_4:5.7']	Atthi hi eko kileso, tena vā ariyadhammā na aññathā aññathā pahātabbo, yathā diṭṭhi rāgo avijjā ca dassanena pahātabbā.🔽Sā ce evañca avijjā bhāvanāya bhūmi vā dhammā bhāvanāya pahātabbā.	atthi hi ekaḥ kilesaḥ tena vā ariya dhammāḥ na aññathā aññathā pahātabbo yathā diṭṭhi rāgaḥ avijjā ca dassanena pahātabbā  sā ce evañca avijjā bhāvanāya bhūmi vā dhammā bhāvanāya pahātabbā 	For there is one defilement that is to be abandoned not otherwise than by seeing, namely, view, lust, and ignorance.🔽And that ignorance is to be abandoned by development.
['PA_pe_4:5.8']	Sāyeva uddhambhāgiyaṁ asaṅkhatadassanāya vimuttiyā animittena cetosamādhinā amanasikārena pahīyati.	sāya iva uddhambhāgiyam asaṅkhata dassanāya vimuttiyāḥ animittena cetosamādhinā amanasikārena pahīyati 	That same ignorance is abandoned by the supramundane path, which is the seeing of the unformed element, by the deliverance of the signless, by the concentration of cognizance on the wishless, by non-attention.
['PA_pe_4:5.9', 'PA_pe_4:5.10_0']	Evaṁ sātthaṁ sabyañjanaṁ upaparikkhitabbaṁ.🔽Ye dassanena pahātabbā kilesā dassanākārena ariyadhammo desito, bhāvanāya pahātabbā	evam sa attham sa byañjanam  ye dassanena pahātabbā kilesā dassana ākārena ariya dhammo desito bhāvanāya pahātabbā 	So it should be investigated as to what is profitable and as to the letter.🔽The defilements to be abandoned by seeing are taught by the Noble Ones’ ideas in the way of seeing,🔽those to be abandoned by development are taught by the Noble Ones’ ideas in the way of development,
['PA_pe_4:5.10_1']	bhāvanākārena ariyadhammo desito, patisevanā pahātabbā patisevanākārena ariyadhammo	bhāvanā ākārena ariya dhammo desito patisevanā pahātabbā patisevanā ākārena ariya dhammo 	those to be abandoned by keeping-in-being are taught by the Noble Ones’ ideas in the way of keeping-in-being,

['PA_pe_4:5.12']	Yadi ayaṁ dhammo pariyesato yo ca deseti yena yenākārena, so ariyadhammo pariyesitabbo, tenākārena kileso pahīyati.	yadi ayam dhammo pariyesataḥ yaḥ ca deseti yena yena ākārena so ariya dhammo pariyesitabbo tena ākārena kileso pahīyati 	If this Dhamma is to be sought by one who teaches it and by one who listens to it, then the Dhamma should be sought in that way.
['PA_pe_4:5.13']	So tattha upaparikkhitabbo.	saḥ tattha upaparikkhitabbaḥ 	It should be investigated there.
['PA_pe_4:5.14']	Atha na yujjati yadi hi tena suttena vihitaṁ suttaṁ vīmaṁsitabbaṁ.	atha na yujjati yadi hi tena suttena vihitam suttam 	If it does not fit, then the sutta should be investigated by that sutta.

['PA_pe_4:5.17']	Na hi paccayā vinā dhammo appaccayo uppajjati.	na hi paccayāḥ vinā dhammaḥ appaccayaḥ uppajjati 	for a state does not arise without conditions, nor does it arise with a non-condition.

['PA_pe_4:6.2']	So ca paccayo tividho—	so ca paccayaḥ tividhaḥ 	And that condition is threefold:
['PA_pe_4:6.3']	mudu majjho adhimatto.	mudu majjhaḥ adhimattaḥ 	weak, medium, and strong.🔽Herein, a weak state should be taken as having a weak condition, and so on.

['PA_pe_4:6.5']	So paccayo mudutena byādhimattaṁ pariyesitabbaṁ.	so paccayaḥ mudu tena byādhimattam 	That condition should be sought by way of the weak-weak disease.
