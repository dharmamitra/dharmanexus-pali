The state of being a recluse is the state of being a recluse in the ultimate sense, and the state of being a brahmin is the state of being a brahmin in the ultimate sense. The state of being a recluse is that by the possession of which a person is called a recluse in the ultimate sense. The state of being a brahmin is that by the possession of which a person is called a brahmin in the ultimate sense. The state of being a recluse and the state of being a brahmin are called the recluse’s state and the brahmin’s state. The recluse’s state and the brahmin’s state are the recluse’s state and the brahmin’s state in the ultimate sense. The recluse’s state and the brahmin’s state in the ultimate sense are what is called the recluse’s state and the brahmin’s state.
