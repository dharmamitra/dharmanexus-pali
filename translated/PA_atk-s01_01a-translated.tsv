Herein, fear of loss of loved ones is this: “Oh, that my mother and father and kinsmen and relatives might not exist, that they might not come to be in the future” . This is called fear of loss of loved ones. Fear of loss of wealth is this: “Oh, that my fields and lands and gold and silver and jewels and property and possessions might not exist, that they might not come to be in the future” .
