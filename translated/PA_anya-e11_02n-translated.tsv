There is no profit beyond this. A cubit’s worth of this is worth a hundred thousand. Let us take as much as we can carry and go.” They did so. The non-human beings living in the sandalwood forest became angry and thought, “These people have destroyed our sandalwood forest. We will kill them.” But they thought again, “If we kill them, everything will become a single corpse. We will sink their ship in the middle of the ocean.” Then, as they were boarding the ship, the non-human beings, after creating a sudden storm, showed themselves in terrifying forms. The people were frightened and paid homage to their own deities. The younger brother of the elder, the householder Cullapuṇṇaka, said, “May my elder brother be my refuge.”

The Teacher pointed out to him the place where he had left his footprint on the rock at Ghanapindiya, and said to him, “There is a place where you may dwell.” Thus in the kingdom of Sūnaparanta two shrines containing relics of the Buddha’s foot were established, and remained there until the disappearance of the Faith.🔽In the seventh year of his ministry the Teacher, while residing at Sāvatthi in the root of a Kandala tree,

You must remain here and give up the gains that they have given you, and cause them to be established in the road that leads to Nibbāna.” He asked the Teacher to take care of him. The Teacher pointed out to him the Cetiya of the Footprint, as if he had marked it with a lump of fresh clay on a flat stone. Thus he established two Cetiyas of the Wheel in the kingdom of Sūnaparanta, and they remained there until the religion disappeared.
