['PA_mil_5.5.11:1.1']	“Bhante nāgasena, bhāsitampetaṁ bhagavatā—	bhante nāgasena bhāsitam petam bhagavatā 	1	“Though, revered Nāgasena, this was said by the Blessed One:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.1']	‘Na me ācariyo atthi,	na me ācariyaḥ atthi 	2	‘I have no teacher,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.2']	sadiso me na vijjati;	sadisaḥ me na vijjati 	2	there is none like me,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.3']	Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ,	sa devakasmin 	2	in the world with its gods,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:2.4']	natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti.	natthi me paṭipuggalo ti 	2	there is no one equal to me.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.1']	Puna ca bhaṇitaṁ—	punar ca bhaṇita 	3	And again it is said:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.2']	‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesi, uḷārāya ca maṁ pūjāya pūjesī’ti.	iti kho bhikkhave āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi uḷārāya ca mam pūjāya pūjesi iti 	3	‘Thus, monks, Āḷāra Kālāma, my teacher, while being my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on the same level as himself, and honoured me with great honour.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.3']	Yadi, bhante nāgasena, tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi bhante nāgasena tathāgatena bhaṇita 	3	If, revered Nāgasena, this was said by the Tathāgata:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.4', 'PA_mil_5.5.11:3.5_0']	‘na me ācariyo atthi, sadiso me na vijjati.🔽Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ, natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti, tena hi ‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro	na me ācariyaḥ atthi sadisaḥ me na vijjati  sa devakasmiṃ lokasmi natthi me paṭipuggalo ti tena hi iti kho bhikkhave āḷāro 	3	‘I have no teacher, there is none like me.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.5_1']	kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesī’ti yaṁ vacanaṁ, taṁ micchā.	kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi iti yam tam micchā 	3	In the world with its gods, there is no one equal to me,’ then the statement that ‘Thus, monks, Āḷāra Kālāma, my teacher, while being my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on the same level as himself,’ is wrong.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.6']	Yadi tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi tathāgatena bhaṇita 	3	If this was said by the Tathāgata:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.7', 'PA_mil_5.5.11:3.8']	‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesī’ti, tena hi ‘na me ācariyo atthi, sadiso me na vijjati.🔽Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ, natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti tampi vacanaṁ micchā.	iti kho bhikkhave āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi iti tena hi na me ācariyaḥ atthi sadisaḥ me na vijjati  sa devakasmiṃ lokasmi natthi me paṭipuggalo ti tat pi vacanam micchā 	3	‘I have no teacher, there is no one like me.🔽In the world with its gods and men,🔽there is no one who is my equal.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:3.9']	Ayampi ubhato koṭiko pañho tavānuppatto, so tayā nibbāhitabbo”ti.	ayam pi ubhatas koṭikaḥ pañho tava anuppatto saḥ tayā nibbāhitabbaḥ ti 	3	“This too is a double-pronged question, profound, hard to penetrate and leading to another, which you have put to me. You must unravel it yourself.”
['PA_mil_5.5.11:4.1']	“Bhāsitampetaṁ, mahārāja, tathāgatena	mahā rāja tathāgatena 	4	“Great king, the Tathāgata has said:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.1']	‘Na me ācariyo atthi,	na me ācariyaḥ atthi 	5	‘I have no teacher,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.2']	sadiso me na vijjati;	sadisaḥ me na vijjati 	5	there is no one like me.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.3']	Sadevakasmiṁ lokasmiṁ,	sa devakasmin 	5	In the world with its gods and men,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:5.4']	natthi me paṭipuggalo’ti.	natthi me paṭipuggalo ti 	5	there is no one who is my equal.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:6.1']	Bhaṇitañca—	bhaṇitam ca 	6	And he has also said:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:6.2']	‘iti kho, bhikkhave, āḷāro kālāmo ācariyo me samāno antevāsiṁ maṁ samānaṁ attanā samasamaṁ ṭhapesi, uḷārāya ca maṁ pūjāya pūjesī’ti.	iti kho bhikkhave āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ācariyaḥ me samānaḥ antevāsim mam samānam attanā samasamam ṭhapesi uḷārāya ca mam pūjāya pūjesi iti 	6	‘Āḷāra Kālāma, my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on the same level as himself, and he honoured me with the highest honour.’
['PA_mil_5.5.11:7.1']	Tañca pana vacanaṁ pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ācariyabhāvaṁ sandhāya bhāsitaṁ.	tat ca pana vacanam pubbā iva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa iva sato ācariya bhāvam sandhāya bhāsita 	7	But this statement was made by the Tathāgata with reference to his state as a teacher before he was fully enlightened.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.1']	Pañcime, mahārāja, pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa sato ācariyā, yehi anusiṭṭho bodhisatto tattha tattha divasaṁ vītināmesi.	pañcime mahā rāja pubbā iva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattassa sataḥ ācariyāḥ yehi anusiṭṭhaḥ bodhisatto tattha tattha divasam vītināmesi 	8	“Great king, there were five teachers of the Bodhisatta before he attained enlightenment.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.2']	Katame pañca?	katame pañca 	8	What were the five?
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.3']	Ye te, mahārāja, aṭṭha brāhmaṇā jātamatte bodhisatte lakkhaṇāni pariggaṇhiṁsu, seyyathidaṁ—	ye te mahā rāja aṭṭha brāhmaṇāḥ jāta matte bodhisatte lakkhaṇāni pariggaṇhisu 	8	“Great king, there were eight brahmins who, as soon as the Bodhisatta was born, examined his marks, namely:
['PA_mil_5.5.11:8.4']	rāmo dhajo lakkhaṇo mantī yañño suyāmo subhojo sudattoti.	rāmaḥ dhajaḥ lakkhaṇaḥ mantī yañño suyāmaḥ subhojaḥ sudatto ti 	8	Rāma, Dhajo, Lakkhaṇa, Manti, Yaggi, Suyāma, Subhajo, and Sudatta.

['PA_mil_5.5.11:9.1_0']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, bodhisattassa pitā suddhodano rājā yaṁ tena samayena abhijātaṁ	puna capara mahā rāja bodhisattassa pitā suddhodanaḥ rājā yam tena samayena abhijāta 	9	“Furthermore, great king, the Bodhisatta’s father, King Suddhodana, brought to him🔽a brahmin named Sabbamitta, who was of high birth,
['PA_mil_5.5.11:9.1_1']	udiccajātimantaṁ padakaṁ veyyākaraṇaṁ chaḷaṅgavantaṁ sabbamittaṁ nāma brāhmaṇaṁ upanetvā	udicca jātimantam padakam veyyākaraṇam chaḷaṅgavantam sabbamittam nāma brāhmaṇam upanetvā 	9	of a pure lineage, a master of the three Vedas, with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and skilled in philology and grammar.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:9.1_2']	sovaṇṇena bhiṅgārena udakaṁ oṇojetvā ‘imaṁ kumāraṁ sikkhāpehī’ti adāsi, ayaṁ dutiyo ācariyo.	sovaṇṇena bhiṅgārena udakam oṇojetvā imam kumāram sikkhāpehi iti adāsi ayam dutiyaḥ ācariyo 	9	Having poured water from a golden jar over the Bodhisatta’s head, he said: ‘Teach this prince.’ He was the second teacher.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:10.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, yā sā devatā bodhisattaṁ saṁvejesi, yassā vacanaṁ sutvā bodhisatto saṁviggo ubbiggo tasmiṁyeva khaṇe nekkhammaṁ nikkhamitvā pabbaji, ayaṁ tatiyo ācariyo.	puna capara mahā rāja yā sā devatā bodhisattam savejesi yassāḥ vacanam sutvā bodhisatto saviggaḥ ubbiggaḥ tasmiya eva khaṇe nekkhammam nikkhamitvā pabbaji ayam tatiyaḥ ācariyo 	10	“Again, sire, that deity who stirred the Bodhisatta to emotion, on hearing whose words the Bodhisatta was stirred and agitated and on that very occasion went forth from home into homelessness, this was his third teacher.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:11.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, āḷāro kālāmo ākiñcaññāyatanassa parikammaṁ ācikkhi, ayaṁ catuttho ācariyo.	puna capara mahā rāja āḷāraḥ kālāmaḥ ākiñcaññāyatanassa parikammaṃ ācikkhi ayam catutthaḥ ācariyo 	11	“Again, sire, Āḷāra Kālāma taught him the preliminary exercise for the sphere of nothingness, this was his fourth teacher.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:12.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, udako rāmaputto nevasaññānāsaññāyatanassa parikammaṁ ācikkhi, ayaṁ pañcamo ācariyo.	puna capara mahā rāja udakaḥ rāmaputto nevasaññānāsaññāyatanassa parikammam ācikkhi ayam pañcamaḥ ācariyo 	12	“Again, sire, Udaka Rāmaputta taught him the preliminary exercise for the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, this was his fifth teacher.

['PA_mil_5.5.11:13.2']	Te ca pana ācariyā lokiye dhamme.	te ca pana ācariyāḥ lokiye dhamme 	13	And these teachers were in the field of worldly things.

For this reason it was said by the Tathāgata:🔽“The Tathāgata, sire, is the foremost, the best, the pre-eminent, the supreme, the highest, the incomparable one among those who have attained enlightenment.
['PA_mil_5.5.11:14.1']	‘Na me ācariyo atthi,	na me ācariyaḥ atthi 	14	‘I have no teacher,
