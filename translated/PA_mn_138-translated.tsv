['PA_mn_138:1.3']	Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi:	tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi 	There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:

['PA_mn_138:4.1']	Idamavoca bhagavā.	idam avoca bhagavān 	This is what the Blessed One said.
['PA_mn_138:4.2']	Idaṁ vatvāna sugato uṭṭhāyāsanā vihāraṁ pāvisi.	idam vatvāna sugataḥ uṭṭhāya āsanā vihāram pāvisi 	Having said this, the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his living quarters.

When one is not sustained by craving and is thus not agitated, one is said to be sustained by the noble ones and to be without agitation. When one is sustained by the noble ones and is without agitation, the origin of suffering, the origin of birth and death, is stopped.

['PA_mn_138:5.6']	Atha kho tesaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ etadahosi:	atha kho tesam bhikkhūnam etat ahosi 	Then the thought occurred to them,

['PA_mn_138:6.5']	Bahiddhā, bhikkhave, viññāṇe avikkhitte avisaṭe sati ajjhattaṁ asaṇṭhite anupādāya aparitassato āyatiṁ jātijarāmaraṇadukkhasamudayasambhavo na hotī’ti.	bahiddhā bhikkhave viññāṇe a vikkhitte a visaṭe sati ajjhattam a saṇṭhite an upādāya a paritassataḥ āyatim jāti jarā maraṇa dukkha samudaya sambhavaḥ na hoti iti 	When consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck internally, and one dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world, then craving for sensual pleasures ceases.
