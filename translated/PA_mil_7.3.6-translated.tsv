['PA_mil_7.3.6:1.3']	evameva kho, mahārāja, yoginā yogāvacarena rāgadosamohūmijāle mahatimahāvitakkasampahāre cittaṁ laggetabbaṁ, na dātabbaṁ disāvidisaṁ harituṁ.	evam eva khalu mahā rāja yoginā yogāvacarena rāga dosa mohūmi jāle mahati mahā vitakka sampahāre cittam na dātabbam disā vidisam 	1	even so, sire, the one who is devoted to mental training should anchor his mind in the great ocean of the many thoughts that arise, in the great flood of the defilements of lust, hatred and delusion, so that it does not drift about in the different directions.
['PA_mil_7.3.6:1.4']	Idaṁ, mahārāja, nāvālagganakassa paṭhamaṁ aṅgaṁ gahetabbaṁ.	mahā rāja nāvā ālagganakassa paṭhamam aṅgam 	1	This, sire, is the first factor that should be taken up in the case of a ship’s captain.
['PA_mil_7.3.6:2.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, nāvālagganakaṁ na plavati visīdati, hatthasatepi udake nāvaṁ laggeti ṭhānamupaneti;	puna capara mahā rāja nāvā ālagganakam na plavati visīdati hattha sate pi udake nāvam laggeti ṭhānam upaneti 	2	“And again, sire, a ship’s captain does not float about, he does not sink, he anchors his ship in the water even a hundred fathoms deep and brings it to rest;

['PA_mil_7.3.6:2.3']	Idaṁ, mahārāja, nāvālagganakassa dutiyaṁ aṅgaṁ gahetabbaṁ.	idam mahā rāja nāvālagganakassa dutiyam aṅgam 	2	This, sire, is the second quality that must be taken up from the helmsman.
['PA_mil_7.3.6:2.4']	Bhāsitampetaṁ, mahārāja, therena sāriputtena dhammasenāpatinā—	mahā rāja therena sāriputtena dhamma senāpatinā 	2	And this was said, sire, by the Elder Sāriputta, the general of the Dhamma:
['PA_mil_7.3.6:3.1']	‘Yathā samudde lagganakaṁ,	yathā samudde 	3	‘As the helmsman on the ocean
