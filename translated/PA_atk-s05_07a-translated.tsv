What is restraint is destruction: the non-giving to anyone of anything out of greed, etc., is restraint. That is destruction for the beings reborn as ghosts, since it is a cause for their great misfortune. “What is destruction is restraint” shows that the meaning stated above is absolute. For ghosts, it seems, know: the word “hi” indicates certainty, and the word “kira” indicates that the speaker does not believe what he says. The ghosts themselves, it seems, know that the non-giving of gifts, which is a cause of destruction, is restraint. They know this because they experience it directly, not because they infer it from other evidence. But this is not right, for it is seen that human beings, like ghosts, are overcome by hunger, thirst, etc. But ghosts know this more clearly because the results of their past kamma are more evident. Therefore they say, “I was restrained in the past,” etc. Herein, they say, “We were restrained” means that they themselves were restrained from giving gifts, making merit, etc.
