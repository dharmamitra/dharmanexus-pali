['PA_mil_6.2.1:3.3', 'PA_mil_6.2.1:4.1_0']	Ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā, te imehi payogehi nippapañcā honti.🔽Yathā, mahārāja, eko puriso khette bījaṁ ropetvā attano yathābalavīriyena vinā pākāravatiyā	ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā te imehi payogehi nippapañcāḥ honti  yathā mahā rāja ekaḥ purisaḥ khette bījam ropetvā yathā bala vīriyena vinā 	3	But those monks who are great kings, sire, they become desireless by means of these efforts.🔽Suppose, sire, a man were to sow seed in a field and, without exerting his strength and energy, were to reap the crop in the threshing-floor
['PA_mil_6.2.1:4.1_1']	dhaññaṁ uddhareyya, eko puriso khette bījaṁ ropetvā vanaṁ pavisitvā kaṭṭhañca sākhañca	dhaññam uddhareyya ekaḥ purisaḥ khette bījam ropetvā vanam pavisitvā kaṭṭham ca sākham ca 	4	which was protected by a fence; and suppose another man were to sow seed in a field and, after entering the forest, were to cut down the trees and branches

['PA_mil_6.2.1:4.4']	Ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā, te imehi payogehi nippapañcā honti, vatipākāraṁ katvā puriso viya dhaññuddhāro.	ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā te imehi payogehi nippapañcāḥ honti vati pākāram katvā puriso viya dhaññuddhāro 	4	But those monks who are great kings in the Dispensation, they become free from the defilements by these means, like a man who gathers the corn after he has broken down the fence and the walls.
['PA_mil_6.2.1:5.1_0']	Yathā vā pana, mahārāja, puriso mahatimahante ambarukkhamatthake phalapiṇḍi bhaveyya,	yathā vā pana mahā rāja purisaḥ mahati mahante amba rukkha matthake phala piṇḍi 	5	Or, sire, suppose there were a cluster of fruits on the top of a great and lofty mango tree,
['PA_mil_6.2.1:5.1_1']	atha tattha yo koci iddhimā āgantvā tassa phalaṁ hareyya, yo pana tattha aniddhimā,	atha tattha yaḥ koci iddhimā āgantvā tassa phalam hareyya yaḥ pana tattha aniddhimā 	5	and then some one with supernormal power should come there and take that fruit, but another who had no such power,
['PA_mil_6.2.1:5.1_2']	so kaṭṭhañca valliñca chinditvā nisseṇiṁ bandhitvā tāya taṁ rukkhaṁ abhiruhitvā phalaṁ hareyya.	saḥ kaṭṭham ca valliñca chinditvā nisseṇim bandhitvā tāya tam rukkham abhiruhitvā phalam hareyya 	5	he would cut down the tree with axe and creeper and make a ladder and climb up the tree and take the fruit.
['PA_mil_6.2.1:5.2']	Yā tattha tassa nisseṇipariyesanā, sā phalatthāya.	yā tattha tassa nisseṇi pariyesanā sā phala tthāya 	5	The search for the ladder there is for the sake of the fruit.

['PA_mil_6.2.1:5.4', 'PA_mil_6.2.1:6.1']	Ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā, te iminā payogena saccāni abhisamenti, nisseṇiyā viya puriso rukkhaphalaṁ haranto.🔽Yathā vā pana, mahārāja, eko puriso atthakaraṇiko ekakoyeva sāmikaṁ upagantvā atthaṁ sādheti.	ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā te iminā payogena saccāni abhisamenti nisseṇiyā viya puriso rukkha phalam harantaḥ  yathā vā pana mahā rāja ekaḥ purisaḥ attha karaṇikaḥ sāmikam upagantvā attham sādha iti 	5	But those monks who are great kings, they realize the truths by this method, like a man on a ladder taking a fruit from a tree.🔽Or, sire, just as a single man who is a craftsman goes to his employer and accomplishes his purpose,
['PA_mil_6.2.1:6.2']	Eko dhanavā dhanavasena parisaṁ vaḍḍhetvā parisāya atthaṁ sādheti.	ekaḥ dhanavā dhana vasena parisam vaḍḍhetvā parisāya attham sādha iti 	6	while another who is rich increases his retinue by means of his wealth and accomplishes his purpose with the help of his retinue.
['PA_mil_6.2.1:6.3']	Yā tattha tassa parisapariyesanā, sā atthatthāya.	yā tattha tassa parisa pariyesanā sā atthatthāya 	6	The search for a retinue is for the sake of the purpose.
['PA_mil_6.2.1:6.4']	Evameva kho, mahārāja, ye te sabhāvaparisuddhā pubbe vāsitavāsanā, te ekacittakkhaṇena chasu abhiññāsu vasibhāvaṁ pāpuṇanti, puriso viya ekako atthasiddhiṁ karonto.	evam eva kho mahā rāja ye te sabhāva parisuddhā pubbe vāsita vāsanā te eka cittakkhaṇena chasu abhiññāsu vasi bhāvam pāpuṇanti puriso viya ekakaḥ attha siddhim karontaḥ 	6	Even so, sire, those who are pure in their own nature and have previously cultivated the habit of meditation, they attain mastery in the six higher knowledges in a single moment of thought, like a single man accomplishing his purpose.
['PA_mil_6.2.1:6.5']	Ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā, te imehi payogehi sāmaññatthamabhisādhenti, parisāya viya puriso atthasiddhiṁ karonto.	ye pana te bhikkhū mahārajakkhā te imehi payogehi sāmaññattham abhisādhenti parisāya viya purisaḥ attha siddhim karontaḥ 	6	But those bhikkhus who are great royal seers achieve the good of the ascetic life by these means, just as a man who makes a living by the sea achieves success by means of the sea.
['PA_mil_6.2.1:7.1']	Uddesopi, mahārāja, bahukāro, paripucchāpi bahukārā, navakammampi bahukāraṁ, dānampi bahukāraṁ, pūjāpi bahukārā tesu tesu karaṇīyesu.	uddesaḥ api mahā rāja bahu kāraḥ paripucchā api bahu kārā nava kammam pi bahukāra dānam pi bahu kāra pūjā api bahu kārā tesu tesu karaṇīyesu 	7	“Instruction, sire, is of great service, questioning is of great service, new work is of great service, giving is of great service, worship is of great service in the various things that have to be done.

['PA_mil_6.2.1:7.3']	Evameva kho, mahārāja, uddesopi bahukāro, paripucchāpi bahukārā, navakammampi bahukāraṁ, dānampi bahukāraṁ, pūjāpi bahukārā tesu tesu karaṇīyesu.	evam eva kho mahā rāja uddesaḥ api bahukāraḥ paripucchā api bahukārā nava kammam pi bahukāra dānam pi bahukāra pūjā api bahukārā tesu tesu karaṇīyesu 	7	even so, sire, instruction is of great service, questioning is of great service, new work is of great service, giving is of great service, worship is of great service in the various things that have to be done.
