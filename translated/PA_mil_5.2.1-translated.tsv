['PA_mil_5.2.1:1.1']	“Bhante nāgasena, bhāsitampetaṁ bhagavatā—	bhante nāgasena bhāsitam petam bhagavatā 	1	“Though, revered sir, it was said by the Blessed One:
['PA_mil_5.2.1:1.2']	‘abhiññāyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, dhammaṁ desemi no anabhiññāyā’ti.	abhiññāya aha bhikkhave dhammam desemi no an abhiññāya ati 	1	‘Bhikkhus, I teach the Dhamma after directly knowing it myself, not without directly knowing it,’
['PA_mil_5.2.1:1.3']	Puna ca vinayapaññattiyā evaṁ bhaṇitaṁ—	puna ca vinaya paññattiyā evam bhaṇita 	1	and though it was said by him in the laying down of the rules of training:
['PA_mil_5.2.1:1.4', 'PA_mil_5.2.1:1.5_0']	‘ākaṅkhamāno, ānanda, saṅgho mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanatū’ti.🔽Kiṁ nu kho, bhante nāgasena, khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni duppaññattāni, udāhu	ākaṅkhamānaḥ ānanda saṅghaḥ mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanatu uti  kim nu kho bhante nāgasena khudda anukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni duppaññattāni udāhu 	1	‘If he wishes, Ananda, after my death the Order may abolish the lesser and minor rules of training,’🔽then why, revered sir, were the lesser and minor rules of training laid down by the Blessed One

['PA_mil_5.2.1:1.6']	Yadi, bhante nāgasena, bhagavatā bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi bhante nāgasena bhagavatā bhaṇita 	1	If, revered sir, it was said by the Blessed One:
['PA_mil_5.2.1:1.7', 'PA_mil_5.2.1:1.8']	‘abhiññāyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, dhammaṁ desemi no anabhiññāyā’ti, tena hi ‘ākaṅkhamāno, ānanda, saṅgho mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanatū’ti yaṁ vacanaṁ, taṁ micchā.🔽Yadi tathāgatena vinayapaññattiyā evaṁ bhaṇitaṁ—	abhiññāya āha bhikkhave dhammam desemi no an abhiññāya ati tena hi ākaṅkhamānaḥ ānanda saṅghaḥ mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni yam tam micchā  yadi tathāgatena vinaya paññattiyā evam bhaṇita 	1	‘I teach the Dhamma after directly knowing it, not without directly knowing it,’ then the statement ‘After my passing, Ānanda, the Sangha may abolish the lesser and minor training rules’ is wrong.
['PA_mil_5.2.1:1.9']	‘ākaṅkhamāno, ānanda, saṅgho mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanatū’ti tena hi ‘abhiññāyāhaṁ, bhikkhave, dhammaṁ desemi no anabhiññāyā’ti tampi vacanaṁ micchā.	ākaṅkhamānaḥ ānanda saṅghaḥ mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanatu uti tena hi abhiññāya āha bhikkhave dhammam desemi no an abhiññāya ati tat pi vacanam micchā 	1	If the Buddha said that the Sangha may abolish the lesser and minor training rules, then the statement ‘I teach the Dhamma after directly knowing it, not without directly knowing it’ is wrong.

['PA_mil_5.2.1:2.2']	‘ākaṅkhamāno, ānanda, saṅgho mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanatū’ti, taṁ pana, mahārāja, tathāgato bhikkhū vīmaṁsamāno āha—	ākaṅkhamānaḥ ānanda saṅghaḥ mamaccayena khuddānukhuddakāni sikkhāpadāni samūhanatu uti tam pana mahā rāja tathāgataḥ bhikkhū vīmasamānaḥ āha 	2	‘If he wishes, Ananda, the Order may abolish the minor and minor rules after my death.’ But the Tathāgata said that, Great King, in testing the monks,

['PA_mil_5.2.1:3.3']	“Na hi, bhante, rājato, bhante, luddhatarā kumārā rajjalobhena taduttariṁ diguṇatiguṇaṁ janapadaṁ pariggaṇheyyuṁ, kiṁ pana te hatthagataṁ janapadaṁ muñceyyun”ti?	na hi bhante rājataḥ bhante luddhatarāḥ kumārāḥ rajja lobhena tad uttarim diguṇa tiguṇam janapadam pariggaṇheyyu kim pana te hattha gatam janapadam muñceyyuḥ iti 	3	“No, revered sir, for the princes are not more greedy for the king’s wealth than for their own, so how could they give up their own kingdom and take over another one?”

['PA_mil_5.2.1:4.1']	“Bhante nāgasena, yaṁ bhagavā āha—	bhante nāgasena yam bhagavān āha 	4	“Revered Nāgasena, you said:

Even the great elders of the past, sire, had doubts about this and they did not make them one. This question was put to the Blessed One in the Dhamma Wheel Revolving Discourse.”
