['PA_mil_7.3.6:1.2']	“Yathā, mahārāja, nāvālagganakaṁ bahuūmijālākulavikkhobhitasalilatale mahatimahāsamudde nāvaṁ laggeti ṭhapeti, na deti disāvidisaṁ harituṁ;	yathā mahā rāja nāvā ālagganakam bahu ūmi jāla ākula vikkhobhita salila tale mahati mahā samudde nāvam laggeti ṭhapeti na deti disāvidisam 	“As, sire, a ship’s captain anchors a ship in the great ocean, fastens it securely to the shore with many ropes and hawsers, so that it does not drift about in the different directions,
['PA_mil_7.3.6:1.3']	evameva kho, mahārāja, yoginā yogāvacarena rāgadosamohūmijāle mahatimahāvitakkasampahāre cittaṁ laggetabbaṁ, na dātabbaṁ disāvidisaṁ harituṁ.	evam eva khalu mahā rāja yoginā yogāvacarena rāga dosa mohūmi jāle mahati mahā vitakka sampahāre cittam na dātabbam disā vidisam 	even so, sire, the one who is devoted to mental training should anchor his mind in the great ocean of the many thoughts that arise, in the great flood of the defilements of lust, hatred and delusion, so that it does not drift about in the different directions.
['PA_mil_7.3.6:1.4']	Idaṁ, mahārāja, nāvālagganakassa paṭhamaṁ aṅgaṁ gahetabbaṁ.	mahā rāja nāvā ālagganakassa paṭhamam aṅgam 	This, sire, is the first factor that should be taken up in the case of a ship’s captain.
['PA_mil_7.3.6:2.1']	Puna caparaṁ, mahārāja, nāvālagganakaṁ na plavati visīdati, hatthasatepi udake nāvaṁ laggeti ṭhānamupaneti;	puna capara mahā rāja nāvā ālagganakam na plavati visīdati hattha sate pi udake nāvam laggeti ṭhānam upaneti 	“And again, sire, a ship’s captain does not float about, he does not sink, he anchors his ship in the water even a hundred fathoms deep and brings it to rest;
['PA_mil_7.3.6:2.2']	evameva kho, mahārāja, yoginā yogāvacarena lābhayasasakkāramānanavandanapūjanaapacitīsu lābhaggayasaggepi na plavitabbaṁ, sarīrayāpanamattake yeva cittaṁ ṭhapetabbaṁ.	evam eva kho mahā rāja yoginā yogāvacarena lābha yasa sakkāra mānana vandana pūjana apacitīsu na plavitabba sarīra yāpana mattake yā iva cittam ṭhapetabba 	Even so, sire, the one who is devoted to mental training should not be carried away by gain, fame, honour, respect, worship, reverence and esteem, or by the acquisition of gain and honour, but should fix his mind on the mere sustenance of the body.

['PA_mil_7.3.6:2.4']	Bhāsitampetaṁ, mahārāja, therena sāriputtena dhammasenāpatinā—	mahā rāja therena sāriputtena dhamma senāpatinā 	And this was said, sire, by the Elder Sāriputta, the general of the Dhamma:
['PA_mil_7.3.6:3.1']	‘Yathā samudde lagganakaṁ,	yathā samudde 	‘As the helmsman on the ocean
