['PA_mn_87:1.1']	Evaṁ me sutaṁ—	evam me suta 	1	Thus have I heard. 
['PA_mn_87:1.2']	ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme.	ekam samayam bhagavā sāvatthiyam viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme 	1	On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
['PA_mn_87:2.1']	Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa gahapatissa ekaputtako piyo manāpo kālaṅkato hoti.	tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa gahapatissa eka puttakaḥ piyaḥ manāpaḥ kālaṅkataḥ hoti 	2	Now on that occasion the only son of a certain householder, who was dear and beloved, had died.
['PA_mn_87:2.2']	Tassa kālaṅkiriyāya neva kammantā paṭibhanti na bhattaṁ paṭibhāti.	tassa kālaṅkiriyāya na iva kammantāḥ paṭibhanti na bhattam paṭibhāti 	2	Because of the death of his son, he did not attend to his duties as a householder; he did not take an interest in his house or in his fields, nor did he take an interest in his property, his cattle, or his servants.
['PA_mn_87:2.3']	So āḷāhanaṁ gantvā kandati:	saḥ u āḷāhanam gantvā kandati 	2	He went to the charnel ground and there wailed:
['PA_mn_87:2.4']	“kahaṁ, ekaputtaka, kahaṁ, ekaputtakā”ti.	ekaputtaka ekaputtaka ati 	2	“Where are you, my only son? Where are you, my only son?”
['PA_mn_87:3.1']	Atha kho so gahapati yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṁ abhivādetvā ekamantaṁ nisīdi. Ekamantaṁ nisinnaṁ kho taṁ gahapatiṁ bhagavā etadavoca:	atha khalu saḥ gahapati yena bhagavā tena upasaṅkami upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantam abhivādetvā ekamantam nisīdi ekamantam nisinnam khalu tam gahapatim bhagavān etat avoca 	3	Then the householder went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One said to him:
['PA_mn_87:3.2']	“na kho te, gahapati, sake citte ṭhitassa indriyāni, atthi te indriyānaṁ aññathattan”ti.	na kho te gahapati sake citte ṭhitassa indriyāni atthi te indriyānaṃ aññathattanti 	3	“Householder, your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mind. Your faculties are deranged.”
['PA_mn_87:3.3']	“Kiñhi me, bhante, indriyānaṁ nāññathattaṁ bhavissati;	kim hi me bhante indriyānam na aññathattam bhavissati 	3	“How could my faculties not be deranged, venerable sir?
['PA_mn_87:3.4']	mayhañhi, bhante, ekaputto piyo manāpo kālaṅkato.	mayhan hi bhante eka puttaḥ piyaḥ manāpaḥ kālaṅkataḥ 	3	My only son, who was dear and beloved to me, has died.
['PA_mn_87:3.5']	Tassa kālaṅkiriyāya neva kammantā paṭibhanti, na bhattaṁ paṭibhāti.	tassa kālaṅkiriyāya na iva kammantāḥ paṭibhanti na bhattam paṭibhāti 	3	When he died, neither work nor food appealed to me.
['PA_mn_87:3.6']	Sohaṁ āḷāhanaṁ gantvā kandāmi:	saḥ aham āḷāhanam gantvā kandāmi 	3	I went to the threshing floor and wept:
['PA_mn_87:3.7']	‘kahaṁ, ekaputtaka, kahaṁ, ekaputtakā’”ti.	ekaputtaka ekaputtaka ati 	3	‘Where are you, my only son? Where are you, my only son?’”
['PA_mn_87:3.8']	“Evametaṁ, gahapati, evametaṁ, gahapati.	evam eta gahapati evam eta gahapati 	3	“That’s how it is, householder. That’s how it is.
['PA_mn_87:3.9']	Piyajātikā hi, gahapati, sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā piyappabhavikā”ti.	piya jātikā hi gahapati soka parideva dukkha domanassa upāyāsā piya ppabhavikā ati 	3	Because of being dear, there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”
['PA_mn_87:3.10']	“Kassa kho nāmetaṁ, bhante, evaṁ bhavissati:	kassa kho nāma ita bhante evam bhavissati 	3	“But, Sir, who would say this:
['PA_mn_87:3.11']	‘piyajātikā sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā piyappabhavikā’ti?	piya jātikā soka parideva dukkha domanassa upāyāsā piya ppabhavikā ati 	3	‘Because of being dear, there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress’?
['PA_mn_87:3.12']	Piyajātikā hi kho, bhante, ānandasomanassā piyappabhavikā”ti.	piya jātikā hi kho bhante ānanda somanassā piya ppabhavikā ati 	3	Because of being dear, there is joy and happiness.”
['PA_mn_87:3.13']	Atha kho so gahapati bhagavato bhāsitaṁ anabhinanditvā paṭikkositvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkāmi.	atha kho saḥ gahapati bhagavataḥ bhāsitam an abhinanditvā paṭikkositvā uṭṭhāya āsanā pakkāmi 	3	Displeased, the householder didn’t approve and left.
['PA_mn_87:4.1']	Tena kho pana samayena sambahulā akkhadhuttā bhagavato avidūre akkhehi dibbanti.	tena kho pana samayena sambahulāḥ akkha dhuttāḥ bhagavataḥ avidūre akkhehi dibbanti 	4	On that occasion, a number of dice-players were gambling with dice not far from the Buddha.
['PA_mn_87:4.2']	Atha kho so gahapati yena te akkhadhuttā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā akkhadhutte etadavoca:	atha kho saḥ gahapati yena te akkhadhuttā tena upasaṅkami upasaṅkamitvā akkhadhutte etat avoca 	4	The householder went up to them and said,
['PA_mn_87:4.3']	“idhāhaṁ, bhonto, yena samaṇo gotamo tenupasaṅkamiṁ; upasaṅkamitvā samaṇaṁ gotamaṁ abhivādetvā ekamantaṁ nisīdiṁ. Ekamantaṁ nisinnaṁ kho maṁ, bhonto, samaṇo gotamo etadavoca:	idha āha bhontaḥ yena samaṇaḥ gotamaḥ tena upasaṅkami upasaṅkamitvā samaṇam gotamam abhivādetvā ekamantam nisīdi ekamantam nisinnam khalu ma bhontaḥ samaṇaḥ gotamaḥ etat avoca 	4	‘I went to the ascetic Gotama, and exchanged greetings with him.
['PA_mn_87:4.4']	‘na kho te, gahapati, sake citte ṭhitassa indriyāni, atthi te indriyānaṁ aññathattan’ti.	na kho te gahapati sake citte ṭhitassa indriyāni atthi te indriyānaṃ aññathattanti 	4	He said: “Householder, your faculties are not those of one who is steady in mind. Your faculties are disturbed, as if you have lost your only son.”
['PA_mn_87:4.5']	Evaṁ vutte, ahaṁ, bhonto, samaṇaṁ gotamaṁ etadavocaṁ:	evam vutte aha bhontaḥ samaṇam gotamam etat avoca 	4	When this was said, I said to the ascetic Gotama:
['PA_mn_87:4.6']	‘kiñhi me, bhante, indriyānaṁ nāññathattaṁ bhavissati;	kim hi me bhante indriyānam na aññathattam bhavissati 	4	“How could my faculties not be disturbed, venerable sir?
['PA_mn_87:4.7']	mayhañhi, bhante, ekaputtako piyo manāpo kālaṅkato.	mayhan hi bhante eka puttakaḥ piyaḥ manāpaḥ kālaṅkataḥ 	4	My only son, who was dear and beloved to me, has died.
['PA_mn_87:4.8']	Tassa kālaṅkiriyāya neva kammantā paṭibhanti, na bhattaṁ paṭibhāti.	tassa kālaṅkiriyāya na iva kammantāḥ paṭibhanti na bhattam paṭibhāti 	4	Since his death, I have not been able to tend to my work, nor does food appeal to me.
['PA_mn_87:4.9']	Sohaṁ āḷāhanaṁ gantvā kandāmi—	saḥ aham āḷāhanam gantvā kandāmi 	4	I go to the charnel ground and weep:
['PA_mn_87:4.10']	kahaṁ, ekaputtaka, kahaṁ, ekaputtakā’ti.	ekaputtaka ekaputtaka ati 	4	“Where are you, my only son? Where are you, my only son?”
['PA_mn_87:4.11']	‘Evametaṁ, gahapati, evametaṁ, gahapati.	evam eta gahapati evam eta gahapati 	4	“So it is, householder, so it is!

['PA_mn_87:4.13', 'PA_mn_87:4.14']	‘Kassa kho nāmetaṁ, bhante, evaṁ bhavissati—🔽piyajātikā sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā piyappabhavikā?	kassa kho nāma ita bhante evam bhavissati  piya jātikā soka parideva dukkha domanassa upāyāsā piya ppabhavikā 	4	‘Sir, who would say that?🔽Sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are dear.’
['PA_mn_87:4.15']	Piyajātikā hi kho, bhante, ānandasomanassā piyappabhavikā’ti.	piya jātikā hi kho bhante ānanda somanassā piya ppabhavikā ati 	4	Sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are dear.’
['PA_mn_87:4.16']	Atha khvāhaṁ, bhonto, samaṇassa gotamassa bhāsitaṁ anabhinanditvā paṭikkositvā uṭṭhāyāsanā pakkamin”ti.	atha khvā āha bhonto samaṇassa gotamassa bhāsitam an abhinanditvā paṭikkositvā uṭṭhāya āsanā pakkaminti 	4	I neither approved nor rejected what he said, but got up from my seat and left.”
['PA_mn_87:4.17']	“Evametaṁ, gahapati, evametaṁ, gahapati.	evam eta gahapati evam eta gahapati 	4	“That’s right, householder. That’s right.
['PA_mn_87:4.18']	Piyajātikā hi, gahapati, ānandasomanassā piyappabhavikā”ti.	piya jātikā hi gahapati ānanda somanassā piya ppabhavikā ati 	4	Sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are dear.”
['PA_mn_87:4.19']	Atha kho so gahapati “sameti me akkhadhuttehī”ti pakkāmi.	atha kho saḥ gahapati sameti me akkhadhuttehi iti pakkāmi 	4	Then the householder thought, “My dice game is coming up,” and he left.
['PA_mn_87:5.1']	Atha kho idaṁ kathāvatthu anupubbena rājantepuraṁ pāvisi.	atha kho idam kathā vatthu anupubbena rājantepuram pāvisi 	5	And this conversation gradually became known in the royal compound.
['PA_mn_87:5.2']	Atha kho rājā pasenadi kosalo mallikaṁ deviṁ āmantesi:	atha khalu rājā pasenadi kosalaḥ mallikam devim āmantesi 	5	Then King Pasenadi told Queen Mallikā,
['PA_mn_87:5.3']	“idaṁ te, mallike, samaṇena gotamena bhāsitaṁ:	idam te mallike samaṇena gotamena bhāsita 	5	“Mallikā, this is what the Buddha said:
['PA_mn_87:5.4']	‘piyajātikā sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā piyappabhavikā’”ti.	piya jātikā soka parideva dukkha domanassa upāyāsā piya ppabhavikā ati 	5	‘Sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are dear.’”
['PA_mn_87:5.5']	“Sacetaṁ, mahārāja, bhagavatā bhāsitaṁ, evametan”ti.	saceta mahā rāja bhagavatā bhāsitaḥ evam etat ti 	5	“If the Blessed One said that, then that is how it is.”

He then went to the Buddha, exchanged pleasantries with him,

As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One,
['PA_mn_87:6.11']	“mallikā, bho gotama, devī bhoto gotamassa pāde sirasā vandati; appābādhaṁ appātaṅkaṁ lahuṭṭhānaṁ balaṁ phāsuvihāraṁ pucchati;	mallikā bho gotama devī bhotaḥ gotamassa pāde sirasā vandati appa ābādham appa ātaṅkam lahu ṭṭhānam balam phāsu vihāram pucchati 	6	“Master Gotama, Queen Mallikā bows down with her head at Master Gotama’s feet and asks if you are healthy, strong, & living comfortably.
