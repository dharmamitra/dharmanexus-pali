An immaterial state is a jhāna that is immaterial. But here the meditation subject is intended. The construction of the words should be understood thus: “One who is developing that, who wants to develop that, first of all, after rising from the fourth jhāna, which is the basis for leaping up to the immaterial states, and after that, by means of the same consciousness that has the fourth jhāna as its object, he defines materiality as ‘materiality’ and immateriality as ‘immateriality’ in the way already described under the fourth jhāna. Then, after that, he sees the danger in materiality and he finds no satisfaction in it. He sees the peace and excellence of immateriality and is satisfied with it. Then, after that, he surmounts the material, that is to say, he surmounts the fourth jhāna, which is material since it has materiality as its object. He does so by means of the same consciousness that has the fourth jhāna as its object, by means of the same consciousness that has the defining of materiality and immateriality as its object. He surmounts it in the way already described under the fourth jhāna. He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space.
