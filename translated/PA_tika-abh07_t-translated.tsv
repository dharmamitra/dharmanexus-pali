And even so, it is not possible to prevent the two kinds of intimation from being included, which are included in the clause “with a single object.” And if it is assumed that “they have a single arising and a single cessation” in the sense that their arising and cessation are simultaneous, then it follows that material states arising and ceasing at the same time as consciousness,
