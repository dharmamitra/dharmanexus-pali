['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.1']	“Bhante nāgasena, bhāsitampetaṁ bhagavatā—	bhante nāgasena bhāsitam petam bhagavatā 	1	“Though the Blessed One said,
['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.2']	‘sampajānamusāvāde pārājiko hotī’ti.	sampajāna musā vāde pārājikaḥ hoti iti 	1	‘One who lies in full awareness is expelled,’

['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.5']	Bhante nāgasena, ko panettha viseso, kiṅkāraṇaṁ, yañcekena musāvādena ucchijjati, yañcekena musāvādena satekiccho hoti?	bhante nāgasena kaḥ pana ittha visesaḥ kiṅkāraṇa yat cekena musāvādena ucchijjati yat cekena musāvādena sa tekicchaḥ hoti 	1	Venerable Nāgasena, what is the difference here, what is the reason why one who lies is expelled and one who lies is not expelled?
['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.6']	Yadi, bhante nāgasena, bhagavatā bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi bhante nāgasena bhagavatā bhaṇita 	1	If, venerable Nāgasena, the Blessed One said,
['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.7']	‘sampajānamusāvāde pārājiko hotī’ti, tena hi ‘sampajānamusāvāde lahukaṁ āpattiṁ āpajjati ekassa santike desanāvatthukan’ti yaṁ vacanaṁ, taṁ micchā.	sampajāna musāvāde pārājikaḥ hoti iti tena hi sampajāna musāvāde lahukam āpattim āpajjati ekassa santike desanā vatthukam ti yam tam micchā 	1	‘One who lies in full awareness is expelled,’ then the statement, ‘One who lies in full awareness commits an offense that can be settled by confession in the presence of one person,’ is wrong.
['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.8']	Yadi tathāgatena bhaṇitaṁ—	yadi tathāgatena bhaṇita 	1	If the Tathāgata said,
['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.9']	‘sampajānamusāvāde lahukaṁ āpattiṁ āpajjati ekassa santike desanāvatthukan’ti, tena hi ‘sampajānamusāvāde pārājiko hotī’ti tampi vacanaṁ micchā.	sampajāna musāvāde lahukam āpattim āpajjati ekassa santike desanā vatthukam ti tena hi sampajāna musāvāde pārājikaḥ hoti iti tat pi vacanam micchā 	1	‘one commits a light offense when lying in full awareness to one person,’ then you should say that ‘one becomes guilty of an offense entailing expulsion when lying in full awareness.’
['PA_mil_5.4.3:1.10']	Ayampi ubhato koṭiko pañho tavānuppatto, so tayā nibbāhitabbo”ti.	ayam pi ubhatas koṭikaḥ pañho tava anuppatto saḥ tayā nibbāhitabbaḥ ti 	1	This too is a double-pronged question, profound, difficult to understand, difficult to penetrate. It has been brought down to you; it is up to you whether to answer or not.”

['PA_mil_5.4.3:2.3']	Bhaṇitañca—	bhaṇitam ca 	2	And he has also said
['PA_mil_5.4.3:2.4']	‘sampajānamusāvāde lahukaṁ āpattiṁ āpajjati ekassa santike desanāvatthukan’ti, tañca pana vatthuvasena garukalahukaṁ hoti.	sampajāna musāvāde lahukam āpattim āpajjati ekassa santike desanā vatthukan ti tat ca pana vatthu vasena garuka lahukam hoti 	2	that ‘one commits a light offense when lying in full awareness to one person.’ But the seriousness or otherwise of the offense depends on the basis.
['PA_mil_5.4.3:2.5']	Taṁ kiṁ maññasi, mahārāja, idha koci puriso parassa pāṇinā pahāraṁ dadeyya, tassa tumhe kiṁ daṇḍaṁ dhārethā”ti?	tam kim maññasi mahā rāja idha koci puriso parassa pāṇinā pahāram dadeyya tassa tumhe kim daṇḍam dhāretha ati 	2	What do you think, great king?
