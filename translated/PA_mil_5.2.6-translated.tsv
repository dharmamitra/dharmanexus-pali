['PA_mil_5.2.6:0.4']	6. Apuññapañha	apuññapañha 	The Chapter about the Unbreakable🔽The Questions about Demerit
['PA_mil_5.2.6:1.1']	“Bhante nāgasena, tumhe bhaṇatha—	bhante nāgasena tumhe bhaṇatha 	“Venerable Nāgasena, you say that
['PA_mil_5.2.6:1.2']	‘yo ajānanto pāṇātipātaṁ karoti, so balavataraṁ apuññaṁ pasavatī’ti.	yaḥ a jānantaḥ pāṇa atipātam karoti saḥ balavataram apuññam pasavati iti 	‘he who kills living beings unknowingly produces stronger demerit.’
['PA_mil_5.2.6:1.3']	Puna ca bhagavatā vinayapaññattiyā bhaṇitaṁ—	puna ca bhagavatā vinaya paññattiyā bhaṇita 	But it has been said by the Blessed One in the laying down of the rules of training:
['PA_mil_5.2.6:1.4', 'PA_mil_5.2.6:1.5']	‘anāpatti ajānantassā’ti.🔽Yadi, bhante nāgasena, ajānitvā pāṇātipātaṁ karonto balavataraṁ apuññaṁ pasavati, tena hi ‘anāpatti ajānantassā’ti yaṁ vacanaṁ, taṁ micchā.	anāpatti a jānantassa ati  yadi bhante nāgasena a jānitvā pāṇātipātam karontaḥ balavataram apuññam pasavati tena hi anāpatti a jānantassa ati yam tam micchā 	‘There is no offence for one who does not know.’🔽If, when he does not know, he produces stronger demerit by killing living beings, then that statement is wrong.
['PA_mil_5.2.6:1.6']	Yadi anāpatti ajānantassa, tena hi ‘ajānitvā pāṇātipātaṁ karonto balavataraṁ apuññaṁ pasavatī’ti tampi vacanaṁ micchā.	yadi anāpatti a jānantassa tena hi a jānitvā pāṇātipātam karontaḥ balavataram apuññam pasavati iti tam pi vacanam micchā 	If there is no offence for one who does not know, then that statement is wrong.
['PA_mil_5.2.6:1.7']	Ayampi ubhato koṭiko pañho duruttaro duratikkamo tavānuppatto, so tayā nibbāhitabbo”ti.	ayam pi ubhatas koṭiko pañhaḥ duruttaraḥ duratikkamo tava anuppatto saḥ tayā nibbāhitabbaḥ ti 	This too is a double-pronged question; it is put to you; it is for you to solve.”
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.1']	“Bhāsitampetaṁ, mahārāja, bhagavatā ‘yo ajānanto pāṇātipātaṁ karoti, so balavataraṁ apuññaṁ pasavatī’ti.	mahā rāja bhagavatā yaḥ a jānantaḥ pāṇātipātam karoti saḥ balavataram apuññam pasavati iti 	“This has been said, sire, by the Blessed One: ‘He who kills living beings unknowingly produces stronger demerit.’
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.2']	Puna ca vinayapaññattiyā bhagavatā bhaṇitaṁ—	puna ca vinaya paññattiyā bhagavatā bhaṇita 	And again, the Blessed One has said in the laying down of the rule of training:
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.3']	‘anāpatti ajānantassā’ti.	anāpatti a jānantassa ati 	‘There is no offence for one who does not know.’
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.4']	Tattha atthantaraṁ atthi.	tattha atthantaram atthi 	Here there is a difference of meaning.
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.5']	Katamaṁ atthantaraṁ?	katamam atthantara 	What is the difference of meaning?
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.6']	Atthi, mahārāja, āpatti saññāvimokkhā, atthi āpatti nosaññāvimokkhā.	atthi mahā rāja āpatti saññā vimokkhā atthi āpatti no saññā vimokkhā 	There is, sire, an offence that is released by the recognition of it, and there is an offence that is not released by the recognition of it.
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.7']	Yāyaṁ, mahārāja, āpatti saññāvimokkhā, taṁ āpattiṁ ārabbha bhagavatā bhaṇitaṁ—	yāya mahā rāja āpatti saññā vimokkhā tam āpattim ārabbha bhagavatā bhaṇita 	The offence that is released by the recognition of it, sire, is the offence referred to by the Blessed One when he said:
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.8']	‘anāpatti ajānantassā’”ti.	anāpatti a jānantassa ati 	‘There is no offence for one who does not know.’“
['PA_mil_5.2.6:2.9']	“Sādhu, bhante nāgasena, evametaṁ tathā sampaṭicchāmī”ti.	sādhu bhante nāgasena evam etam tathā sampaṭicchāmi iti 	“It is good, revered Nāgasena, so it is, therefore do I accept it.”
['PA_mil_5.2.6:3.1']	Apuññapañho chaṭṭho.	apuññapañhaḥ chaṭṭhaḥ 	The sixth question on demerit is concluded.
