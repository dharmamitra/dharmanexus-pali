['PA_ne_8:1.1']	Tattha katamo lakkhaṇo hāro?	tattha katamaḥ lakkhaṇaḥ hāro 	1	Herein, what is the mode conveying characteristics? 
['PA_ne_8:1.2']	“Vuttamhi ekadhamme”ti, ayaṁ lakkhaṇo hāro.	vuttamhi eka dhamme ti ayam lakkhaṇaḥ hāro 	1	“When one idea is stated” : this is the mode conveying characteristics. 
['PA_ne_8:1.3']	Kiṁ lakkhayati?	kim lakkhayati 	1	What does it characterize? 
['PA_ne_8:1.4']	Ye dhammā ekalakkhaṇā, tesaṁ dhammānaṁ ekasmiṁ dhamme vutte avasiṭṭhā dhammā vuttā bhavanti.	ye dhammā eka lakkhaṇā tesam dhammānam ekasmin dhamme vutte avasiṭṭhāḥ dhammāḥ vuttāḥ bhavanti 	1	Ideas that have a single characteristic, when one of them is stated, the rest are stated too. 
['PA_ne_8:1.5']	Yathā kiṁ bhave?	yathā kim bhave 	1	How is that? 
['PA_ne_8:1.6']	Yathāha bhagavā—	yathā āha bhagavān 	1	As the Blessed One said: 
['PA_ne_8:2.1']	“Cakkhuṁ, bhikkhave, anavaṭṭhitaṁ ittaraṁ parittaṁ pabhaṅgu parato dukkhaṁ byasanaṁ calanaṁ kukkuḷaṁ saṅkhāraṁ vadhakaṁ amittamajjhe”.	cakkhu bhikkhave anavaṭṭhitam ittaram parittam pabhaṅgu paratas dukkham byasanam calanam kukkuḷam saṅkhāram vadhakam amitta majjhe 	2	“Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent, painful, not-self, subject to break-up, to be abandoned. …

['PA_ne_8:2.4']	Sabbāni hi cha ajjhattikāni āyatanāni vadhakaṭṭhena ekalakkhaṇāni.	sabbāni hi cha ajjhattikāni āyatanāni vadhaka ṭṭhena eka lakkhaṇāni 	2	Because all the six internal sense bases have a single characteristic in being subject to destruction. 
['PA_ne_8:2.5']	Yathā cāha bhagavā—	yathā ca āha bhagavān 	2	And as the Blessed One said: 
['PA_ne_8:3.1']	“Atīte, rādha, rūpe anapekkho hohi, anāgataṁ rūpaṁ mā abhinandi, paccuppannassa rūpassa nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya cāgāya paṭinissaggāya paṭipajja”.	atīte rādha rūpe anapekkhaḥ hohi anāgatam rūpam mā abhinandi paccuppannassa rūpassa nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya cāgāya paṭinissaggāya paṭipajja 	3	“Rādha, be uninterested in past form.

['PA_ne_8:3.2']	Imasmiṁ rūpakkhandhe vutte avasiṭṭhā khandhā vuttā bhavanti.	imasmin rūpa kkhandhe vutte avasiṭṭhāḥ khandhāḥ vuttāḥ bhavanti 	3	When this aggregate of form is spoken of, the remaining aggregates are also spoken of.
['PA_ne_8:3.3']	Kena kāraṇena?	kena kāraṇena 	3	For what reason?
['PA_ne_8:3.4']	Sabbe hi pañcakkhandhā yamakovādasutte vadhakaṭṭhena ekalakkhaṇā vuttā.	sabbe hi pañca kkhandhā yamakovāda sutte vadhaka ṭṭhena eka lakkhaṇā vuttā 	3	For all the five aggregates are said to have the same characteristic as that of the killer in the Yamaka Sutta.
['PA_ne_8:3.5']	Yathā cāha bhagavā—	yathā ca āha bhagavān 	3	And the Blessed One has said:

['PA_ne_8:5.3']	Yathā cāha bhagavā—	yathā ca āha bhagavān 	5	And the Blessed One has said:

['PA_ne_8:6.2_2']	satipaṭṭhānā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti.	sati paṭṭhānāḥ bhāvanā pāripūrim gacchanti 	6	Thus, when he abides contemplating the body as a body, the four foundations of mindfulness come to fulfilment in him.
