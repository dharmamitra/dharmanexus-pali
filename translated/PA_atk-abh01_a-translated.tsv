Then that being becomes one who goes to distinction quickly.” In this way too it can be understood how profitable consciousness arises accompanied by knowledge. And likewise when those who have reached the stage of maturity of the faculties have reached the stage of the five faculties beginning with faith, then profitable consciousness arises accompanied by knowledge, supported by the maturity of the faculties. And when those in whom defilements have been suppressed have reached the state of remoteness of defilements, then profitable consciousness arises accompanied by knowledge, supported by the remoteness of defilements. And this is said: “From yoking comes much, Unyoking is the destruction of much” . So it should be understood that the accompaniment by knowledge comes about through these causes, namely, kamma, rebirth, maturity of faculties, and remoteness of defilements.

For when the restriction is made in this way, it is understood that surely the sensual desires are the opposing states to this jhāna, since it does not occur when they are present, like the light of a lamp when darkness is present, and that it is only by giving up the sensual desires that it is attained, like the near shore only by giving up the far shore.

That should be understood as “accumulated” . The middle is that which is in the middle between the low and the high. The high is that which has reached the state of being the best ; the meaning is, the superior. And these should be understood as “accumulated” too. For when the desire or energy or consciousness or investigation is low in the moment of accumulation, then that is called low. When those ideas are middle and high, then that is called middle and high. But that which is accumulated with desire called “wanting to do” as the principal factor, with desire as the chief, with desire as the forerunner, is called “with predominance of desire” because it has come from the predominance of desire. The same method applies in the case of “with predominance of energy” and so on. But in this place the methods should be reckoned as follows. For one method has already been analysed first, namely, “low” .

But since the emergence of the path does not come about merely by seeing them as internal, he also sees them as external, in another’s aggregates and in primary and derived materiality not conjoined with mind.

So it is stated otherwise, and therefore form is not drowsiness. Consequently, it should be understood that the immaterial itself is drowsiness, since the sutta passages beginning with the words “Having abandoned these five hindrances” and other sutta passages show that it is the immaterial.
