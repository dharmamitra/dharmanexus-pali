['PA_mn_87:1.1']	Evaṁ me sutaṁ—	evam me suta 	Thus have I heard. 
['PA_mn_87:1.2']	ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme.	ekam samayam bhagavā sāvatthiyam viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme 	On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

['PA_mn_87:2.3']	So āḷāhanaṁ gantvā kandati:	saḥ u āḷāhanam gantvā kandati 	He went to the charnel ground and there wailed:
['PA_mn_87:2.4']	“kahaṁ, ekaputtaka, kahaṁ, ekaputtakā”ti.	ekaputtaka ekaputtaka ati 	“Where are you, my only son? Where are you, my only son?”

The Blessed One said to him:
['PA_mn_87:3.2']	“na kho te, gahapati, sake citte ṭhitassa indriyāni, atthi te indriyānaṁ aññathattan”ti.	na kho te gahapati sake citte ṭhitassa indriyāni atthi te indriyānaṃ aññathattanti 	“Householder, your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mind. Your faculties are deranged.”

Your faculties are disturbed, as if you have lost your only son.”
['PA_mn_87:4.5']	Evaṁ vutte, ahaṁ, bhonto, samaṇaṁ gotamaṁ etadavocaṁ:	evam vutte aha bhontaḥ samaṇam gotamam etat avoca 	When this was said, I said to the ascetic Gotama:

['PA_mn_87:4.19']	Atha kho so gahapati “sameti me akkhadhuttehī”ti pakkāmi.	atha kho saḥ gahapati sameti me akkhadhuttehi iti pakkāmi 	Then the householder thought, “My dice game is coming up,” and he left.
