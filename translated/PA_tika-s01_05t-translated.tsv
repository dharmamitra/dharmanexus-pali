The “change” is the attainment of a different state. “By which” is by the seven-day life, and so on. The construction is: just as it should be.

By saying “they experience pleasure and pain” the Ājīvaka shows that he does not know the state of neither-pain-nor-pleasure at all. “He shows that there is no other state of neither-pain-nor-pleasure” is said by the teacher, taking the words “they experience pleasure and pain” as a means of doing. But in the books the reading is found as “he shows that there is no other state of pleasure and pain,” not “he shows that there is no other state of neither-pain-nor-pleasure.” When it is so, the teacher’s opinion is that the words “they experience pleasure and pain” are taken as a basis. “He shows that there is no other state of pleasure and pain” is said by the teacher, taking the words “they experience pleasure and pain” as a means of doing.

['PA_tika-s01_05t:129_11']	ayañcattho yuttataroti.	ayam catthaḥ yuttataroti 	1291	This is the more reasonable explanation of the meaning to be rejected, since it is stated in terms of a plane. For if the seeing to be rejected were shown by the words “they feel pleasure and pain,” then if it were shown that “there is no third kind apart from pleasure and pain,” it would not be shown by the words “there is no plane of neither- pleasure-nor-pain” because that meaning of plane is absent. But if it is shown, then it shows only the absence of a plane for those . Consequently it can be understood that this reading is correct and that this meaning is the more reasonable.

The intention is that he was concealing his doctrine of a self. In the text, the statement “The gross, friend, is the self” is a reference to the wanderer. The intention is this: since the doctrine-holder grasped the four-aggregate continuum as a unity and held it to be a gross self because it was material, and since he imagined it to be eternal by assuming that it was sustained by food and drink, and since the doctrine of the Vedas is well known to be twofold, namely, “made of food” and “made of drink,” therefore the wanderer, referring to the doctrine-holder’s self, said “The gross, friend, is the self.”
