For it is that one of the two nostril winds which is evident that should be taken. “He should advert to it as ‘In-breath’ or ‘Out-breath’” means that he should advert to it as “in” or as “out” accordingly as it is an in-breath or an out-breath. “As it occurs, as it occurs”: by the words “as it occurs, as it occurs” he shows the characteristic of the in-breaths and out-breaths as uninterrupted. “Thus”: the meaning is “having adverted in the way just described.” When he counts, adverting thus to each in-breath and out-breath as it occurs, then both in-breaths and out-breaths become evident to him in the end. That is why it is said: “In-breaths and out-breaths become evident.” So the words “He should count … in this way” should be regarded as a reason for the words “As he adverts thus to each in-breath and out-breath, in-breaths and out-breaths become evident to him.”
