['PA_iti_7:3.2']	sabbatthesu na rajjati;	sabbatthesu na rajjati 	he is not tied to any of the all.

['PA_iti_7:3.4', 'PA_iti_7:4.1']	sabbadukkhamupaccagā”ti.🔽Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti.	sabba dukkham upaccagāti  ayam pi atthaḥ vuttaḥ bhagavatā iti me sutam ti 	and has gone beyond all suffering.”
['PA_iti_7:4.2']	Sattamaṁ.	sattama 	This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So it was with reference to this that it was said by the Blessed One: “The ending of all is the way to the Beyond.”🔽The seventh section on the ending of all is finished.
