['PA_mn_38:1.1']	Evaṁ me sutaṁ—	evam me suta 	1	Thus have I heard. 
['PA_mn_38:1.2']	ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme.	ekam samayam bhagavā sāvatthiyam viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme 	1	Once the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 
['PA_mn_38:2.1']	Tena kho pana samayena sātissa nāma bhikkhuno kevaṭṭaputtassa evarūpaṁ pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ uppannaṁ hoti:	tena kho pana samayena sātissa nāma bhikkhuno kevaṭṭa puttassa evarūpam pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam uppannam hoti 	2	Now at that time a bad and erroneous view had arisen in a monk named Sāti, the son of a fisherman.
['PA_mn_38:2.2']	“tathāhaṁ bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati anaññan”ti.	tathā aham bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati anaññanti 	2	He said, “As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s this same consciousness that runs and wanders in the cycle of rebirths, not another.”
['PA_mn_38:3.1']	Assosuṁ kho sambahulā bhikkhū:	assosum kho sambahulāḥ bhikkhū 	3	A number of monks heard that
['PA_mn_38:3.2']	“sātissa kira nāma bhikkhuno kevaṭṭaputtassa evarūpaṁ pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ uppannaṁ:	sātissa kira nāma bhikkhuno kevaṭṭa puttassa evarūpam pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam uppanna 	3	“It seems that a bad and erroneous view has arisen in the monk Sāti, the son of a fisherman.
['PA_mn_38:3.3']	‘tathāhaṁ bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan’”ti.	tathā aham bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati anaññanti 	3	He says, ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s this same consciousness that runs and wanders in the cycle of rebirths, not another.’”🔽Then those monks went to Sāti and said to him,
['PA_mn_38:3.4']	Atha kho te bhikkhū yena sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭaputto tenupasaṅkamiṁsu; upasaṅkamitvā sātiṁ bhikkhuṁ kevaṭṭaputtaṁ etadavocuṁ:	atha kho te bhikkhū yena sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭa putto tena upasaṅkamisu upasaṅkamitvā sātim bhikkhum kevaṭṭa puttam etat avocu 	3	“Is it true, Sāti, that such a bad and erroneous view has arisen in you?”
['PA_mn_38:3.5']	“saccaṁ kira te, āvuso sāti, evarūpaṁ pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ uppannaṁ:	saccam kira te āvuso sāti evarūpam pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam uppanna 	3	“Is it true, Sāti, that you have such a bad view as this:
['PA_mn_38:3.6']	‘tathāhaṁ bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan’”ti?	tathā aham bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati anaññanti 	3	‘I understand the Dhamma taught by the Buddha like this: it’s this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another’?”
['PA_mn_38:3.7']	“Evaṁ byā kho ahaṁ, āvuso, bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan”ti.	evam kho aha āvuso bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati 	3	“Exactly, Venerables. I understand the Dhamma taught by the Buddha like this: it’s this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another.”
['PA_mn_38:3.8']	Atha kho te bhikkhū sātiṁ bhikkhuṁ kevaṭṭaputtaṁ etasmā pāpakā diṭṭhigatā vivecetukāmā samanuyuñjanti samanugāhanti samanubhāsanti:	atha kho te bhikkhū sātim bhikkhum kevaṭṭa puttam etasmai pāpakāḥ diṭṭhi gatāḥ vivecetu kāmā samanuyuñjanti samanugāhanti samanubhāsanti 	3	Then those monks, wanting to extricate Sāti from his view, questioned and examined him:
['PA_mn_38:3.9']	“mā evaṁ, āvuso sāti, avaca, mā bhagavantaṁ abbhācikkhi, na hi sādhu bhagavato abbhakkhānaṁ, na hi bhagavā evaṁ vadeyya.	mā eva āvuso sā ati avaca mā bhagavantam abbhācikkhi na hi sādhu bhagavataḥ na hi bhagavā evam vadeyya 	3	“Don’t say that, Sāti. Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not right to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing.
['PA_mn_38:3.10']	Anekapariyāyenāvuso sāti, paṭiccasamuppannaṁ viññāṇaṁ vuttaṁ bhagavatā, aññatra paccayā natthi viññāṇassa sambhavo”ti.	aneka pariyāyena āvuso sā ati paṭicca samuppannam viññāṇam vuttam bhagavatā aññatra paccayāḥ natthi viññāṇassa sambhavaḥ ti 	3	In many discourses the Buddha has stated that consciousness is dependent for its origination. Apart from conditions there is no origination of consciousness.”
['PA_mn_38:3.11']	Evampi kho sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭaputto tehi bhikkhūhi samanuyuñjiyamāno samanugāhiyamāno samanubhāsiyamāno tadeva pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ thāmasā parāmāsā abhinivissa voharati:	evam pi kho sā ati bhikkhu kevaṭṭa putto tehi bhikkhūhi samanuyuñjiyamānaḥ samanugāhiyamānaḥ samanubhāsiyamānaḥ tat eva pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam thāmasā parāmāsāḥ abhinivissa voharati 	3	Although he was questioned and admonished by the monks in this way, the monk Sati, son of a fisherman, still obstinately adhered to that bad viewpoint, and continued to insist on it.
['PA_mn_38:3.12', 'PA_mn_38:4.1_0']	“evaṁ byā kho ahaṁ, āvuso, bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati anaññan”ti.🔽Yato kho te bhikkhū nāsakkhiṁsu sātiṁ bhikkhuṁ kevaṭṭaputtaṁ etasmā pāpakā diṭṭhigatā	evam kho aha āvuso bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati  yatas kho te bhikkhū na asakkhisu sātim bhikkhum kevaṭṭa puttam etasmā pāpakā diṭṭhi gatā 	3	“That’s the way I understand the Dhamma taught by the Buddha to be,” he said, “since this consciousness of mine keeps running & circling around right there, not penetrating any further.”🔽When the monks were unable to pry the monk Sati, son of a fisherman, away from that bad viewpoint, they went to the Blessed One, bowed down, sat to one side,
['PA_mn_38:4.1_1', 'PA_mn_38:4.1_2']	vivecetuṁ, atha kho te bhikkhū yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṁsu; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṁ🔽abhivādetvā ekamantaṁ nisīdiṁsu.

['PA_mn_38:4.2']	“sātissa nāma, bhante, bhikkhuno kevaṭṭaputtassa evarūpaṁ pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ uppannaṁ:	sātissa nāma bhante bhikkhuno kevaṭṭa puttassa evarūpam pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam uppanna 	4	“Monks, there is the case where a monk’s effluents, stirred & consolidated, keep running & circling around right there.
['PA_mn_38:4.3']	‘tathāhaṁ bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan’ti.	tathā aham bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati anaññanti 	4	‘I understand the Dhamma taught by the Buddha like this: it’s this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another.’
['PA_mn_38:4.4']	Assumha kho mayaṁ, bhante, sātissa kira nāma bhikkhuno kevaṭṭaputtassa evarūpaṁ pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ uppannaṁ:	assumha kho bhante sātissa kira nāma bhikkhuno kevaṭṭa puttassa evarūpam pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam uppanna 	4	We heard that the monk Sāti, the son of a fisherman, had such a view.
['PA_mn_38:4.5']	‘tathāhaṁ bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan’ti.	tathā aham bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati anaññanti 	4	‘I understand the Dhamma taught by the Buddha like this: it’s this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another.’🔽So we went to him and asked him if this was indeed his view.
['PA_mn_38:4.6', 'PA_mn_38:4.7', 'PA_mn_38:4.8', 'PA_mn_38:4.9']	Atha kho mayaṁ, bhante, yena sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭaputto tenupasaṅkamimha; upasaṅkamitvā sātiṁ bhikkhuṁ kevaṭṭaputtaṁ etadavocumha:🔽‘saccaṁ kira te, āvuso sāti, evarūpaṁ pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ uppannaṁ:🔽“tathāhaṁ bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan”’ti?🔽Evaṁ vutte, bhante, sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭaputto amhe etadavoca:	atha kho bhante yena sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭa putto tena upasaṅkamimha upasaṅkamitvā sātim bhikkhum kevaṭṭa puttam etat avocumha 🔽saccam kira te āvuso sāti evarūpam pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam uppanna 🔽tathā aham bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati anaññanti 🔽evam vutte bhante sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭa puttaḥ amhe etat avoca 	4	He said it was.
['PA_mn_38:4.10']	‘evaṁ byā kho ahaṁ, āvuso, bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan’ti.	evam kho aha āvuso bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati 	4	‘That’s how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Buddha, in that it’s this very consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another.’
['PA_mn_38:4.11']	Atha kho mayaṁ, bhante, sātiṁ bhikkhuṁ kevaṭṭaputtaṁ etasmā pāpakā diṭṭhigatā vivecetukāmā samanuyuñjimha samanugāhimha samanubhāsimha:	atha kho bhante sātim bhikkhum kevaṭṭa puttam etasmai pāpakāḥ diṭṭhi gatāḥ vivecetu kāmā samanuyuñjimha samanugāhimha samanubhāsimha 	4	Then, Venerable Sir, wanting to pry Sāti from that bad viewpoint, we pressed him further:
['PA_mn_38:4.12']	‘mā evaṁ, āvuso sāti, avaca, mā bhagavantaṁ abbhācikkhi, na hi sādhu bhagavato abbhakkhānaṁ, na hi bhagavā evaṁ vadeyya.	mā eva āvuso sā ati avaca mā bhagavantam abbhācikkhi na hi sādhu bhagavataḥ na hi bhagavā evam vadeyya 	4	‘Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not right to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing.
['PA_mn_38:4.13']	Anekapariyāyenāvuso sāti, paṭiccasamuppannaṁ viññāṇaṁ vuttaṁ bhagavatā, aññatra paccayā natthi viññāṇassa sambhavo’ti.	aneka pariyāyena āvuso sā ati paṭicca samuppannam viññāṇam vuttam bhagavatā aññatra paccayāḥ natthi viññāṇassa sambhavaḥ ti 	4	In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness comes into play due to a condition, that without a condition there is no coming into play of consciousness.’
['PA_mn_38:4.14']	Evampi kho, bhante, sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭaputto amhehi samanuyuñjiyamāno samanugāhiyamāno samanubhāsiyamāno tadeva pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ thāmasā parāmasā abhinivissa voharati:	evam pi kho bhante sāti bhikkhu kevaṭṭa putto amhehi samanuyuñjiyamānaḥ samanugāhiyamānaḥ samanubhāsiyamānaḥ tat eva pāpakam diṭṭhi gatam thāmasā parāmasā abhinivissa voharati 	4	But even though pressed further by us, Sāti still obstinately held on to that bad viewpoint, insisting on it and defending it.
['PA_mn_38:4.15']	‘evaṁ byā kho ahaṁ, āvuso, bhagavatā dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhāvati saṁsarati, anaññan’ti.	evam kho aha āvuso bhagavatā dhammam desitam ājānāmi yathā tat eva idam viññāṇam sandhāvati sasarati 	4	‘That’s how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Buddha, in that it’s this very consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not anything else.’
['PA_mn_38:4.16']	Yato kho mayaṁ, bhante, nāsakkhimha sātiṁ bhikkhuṁ kevaṭṭaputtaṁ etasmā pāpakā diṭṭhigatā vivecetuṁ, atha mayaṁ etamatthaṁ bhagavato ārocemā”ti.	yatas kho maya bhante na asakkhimha sātim bhikkhum kevaṭṭa puttam etasmai pāpakā diṭṭhi gatā vivecetu atha mayam etam attham bhagavataḥ ārocema iti 	4	Since we were unable to get Sāti to give up that view, we have reported the matter to the Buddha.”
['PA_mn_38:5.1']	Atha kho bhagavā aññataraṁ bhikkhuṁ āmantesi:	atha kho bhagavā aññataram bhikkhum āmantesi 	5	Then the Buddha said to a certain monk,
['PA_mn_38:5.2']	“ehi tvaṁ bhikkhu, mama vacanena sātiṁ bhikkhuṁ kevaṭṭaputtaṁ āmantehi:	ehi tvam bhikkhu mama vacanena sātim bhikkhum kevaṭṭa puttam āmantehi 	5	“Please go to the monk Sāti and say to him,

Is form permanent or impermanent?”🔽“Impermanent, venerable sir.”🔽“What do you think, Sāti? Is feeling… perception… volitional formations… consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
['PA_mn_38:5.12']	“Kassa nu kho nāma tvaṁ, moghapurisa, mayā evaṁ dhammaṁ desitaṁ ājānāsi?	kassa nu kho nāma tva mogha purisa mayā evam dhammam desitam ājānāsi 	5	“What do you think, Sāti?

['PA_mn_38:6.1']	Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi:	atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi 	6	Then the Buddha said to the monks,
