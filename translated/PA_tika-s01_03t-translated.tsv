Therefore it is said that the moon “gradually waxes.” On the Uposatha day of the full moon it is “full,” complete. Its disk appears full. “It is caught as it runs”: because the moon moves slowly and the sun quickly. “Gradually wanes”: the meaning should be understood in the way stated in the case of waxing. For there the disk appears to wax by reason of the gradual disappearance of the shadows; here it appears to wane by reason of the gradual disappearance of the illuminated area.
