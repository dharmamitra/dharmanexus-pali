['PA_pe_7:3.1']	Vitakkāti tayo vitakkā—	vitakkā ati tayaḥ vitakkā 	3	“Thinking” : there are three kinds of thinking :
['PA_pe_7:3.2']	nekkhammavitakko abyāpādavitakko avihiṁsāvitakko.	nekkhamma vitakko a byāpāda vitakko a vihisā vitakko 	3	thinking of renunciation, thinking of non-ill-will, thinking of non-cruelty.

Sustained thought is in the discrimination of ideas and in the discrimination of meanings.
['PA_pe_7:3.14']	Kallitā kosallattaṁ cittassa vitakko, abhinīhārakosallaṁ cittassa vicāro.	kallitā kosallattam cittassa vitakkaḥ abhinīhāra kosallam cittassa vicāro 	3	Applied thought is the skill in the shaping of cognizance; sustained thought is the skill in the directing of cognizance.
['PA_pe_7:3.15']	Idaṁ kusalaṁ idaṁ akusalaṁ idaṁ bhāvetabbaṁ idaṁ pahātabbaṁ idaṁ sacchikātabbanti vitakko, yathā pahānañca bhāvanā ca sacchikiriyā ca evaṁ vicāro.	idam kusalam idam akusalam idam bhāvetabbam idam pahātabbam idam sacchikātabbanti vitakkaḥ yathā pahānam ca bhāvanā ca sacchikiriyā ca evam vicāraḥ 	3	Applied thought is the idea that this is profitable, this unprofitable, this to be developed, this to be abandoned, this to be realized. Sustained thought is the idea that this is how there is the abandoning of this, how there is the development of this, how there is the realization of this.

['PA_pe_7:3.18']	Iti vitakkajanitaṁ cetasikaṁ sukhaṁ pīti kāyikaṁ sukhaṁ kāyikoyeva.	iti vitakka janitam cetasikam sukham pīti kāyikam sukham 	3	So the mental pleasure born of applied thought is happiness, and the bodily pleasure is bodily ease.
['PA_pe_7:3.19']	Yā tattha cittassa ekaggatā, ayaṁ samādhi.	yā tattha cittassa ekagga tā ayam samādhi 	3	The unification of cognizance there is concentration.
['PA_pe_7:3.20']	Iti paṭhamaṁ jhānaṁ pañcaṅgavippahīnaṁ pañcaṅgasamannāgataṁ.	iti paṭhamam jhānam pañcaṅga vippahīnam pañcaṅga samannāgata 	3	So the first jhana has five factors, since it is devoid of applied thought and sustained thought, and possesses the remaining five factors.

['PA_pe_7:5.4', 'PA_pe_7:5.5']	Yena satisampajaññena upekkhāpāripūriṁ gacchati.🔽Idaṁ tatiyaṁ jhānaṁ caturaṅgasamannāgataṁ.	yena sati sampajaññena upekkhā pāripūrim gacchati  idam tatiyam jhānam catur aṅga samannāgata 	5	With the fading away of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’🔽And with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.
