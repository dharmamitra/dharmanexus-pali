It seems that a certain devaputta came to the Blessed One at Savatthi while he was living there and asked him this question in order to have his own doubt resolved:🔽“The tangle in the heart and in the world

It is a net because it spreads out over the six kinds of objects, forms and the rest, and it is a tangle because it is hard to disentangle by those who are not clever.

And this is called an internal tangle and an external tangle because it arises in one’s own and in another’s aggregates, etc.,

The meaning is that it is entangled.🔽And because it is entangled, therefore I ask Gotama:
