['PA_iti_49:1.1']	Vuttañhetaṁ bhagavatā vuttamarahatāti me sutaṁ:	vuttam ha etam bhagavatā vuttam arahatā iti me suta 	1	This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:
['PA_iti_49:2.1']	“Dvīhi, bhikkhave, diṭṭhigatehi pariyuṭṭhitā devamanussā olīyanti eke, atidhāvanti eke; cakkhumanto ca passanti.	dvīhi bhikkhave diṭṭhi gatehi pariyuṭṭhitāḥ deva manussāḥ olīyanti eke atidhāvanti eke cakkhumanto ca passanti 	2	“Monks, gods and humans are tied up in two views. Some are tied up in the view of becoming, while others, who are repelled, ashamed, and disgusted with becoming, delight in the view of non-becoming. Those with vision see:
['PA_iti_49:3.1']	Kathañca, bhikkhave, olīyanti eke?	kathañca bhikkhave olīyanti eke 	3	“And how, monks, are some tied up in the view of becoming?
['PA_iti_49:3.2']	Bhavārāmā, bhikkhave, devamanussā bhavaratā bhavasammuditā tesaṁ bhavanirodhāya dhamme desiyamāne cittaṁ na pakkhandati na pasīdati na santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati.	bhava ārāmāḥ bhikkhave deva manussāḥ bhava ratāḥ bhava sammuditā tesam bhava nirodhāya dhamme desiyamāne cittam na pakkhandati na pasīdati na santiṭṭhati na adhimuccati 	3	Gods and humans delight in becoming, take pleasure in becoming, enjoy becoming. When the Dhamma is taught to them for the cessation of becoming, their minds do not enter into it, acquire confidence in it, settle upon it, or resolve upon it.
['PA_iti_49:3.3']	Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, olīyanti eke.	evam kho bhikkhave olīyanti eke 	3	That’s how some are tied up in the view of becoming.
['PA_iti_49:4.1']	Kathañca, bhikkhave, atidhāvanti eke?	kathañca bhikkhave atidhāvanti eke 	4	“And how, monks, are some tied up in the view of non-becoming?
['PA_iti_49:4.2']	Bhaveneva kho paneke aṭṭīyamānā harāyamānā jigucchamānā vibhavaṁ abhinandanti—	bhavena iva khalu paneke aṭṭīyamānāḥ harāyamānāḥ jigucchamānāḥ vibhavam abhinandanti 	4	Some, being repelled, ashamed, and disgusted with becoming, delight in the view of non-becoming:
['PA_iti_49:4.3']	yato kira, bho, ayaṁ attā kāyassa bhedā paraṁ maraṇā ucchijjati vinassati na hoti paraṁ maraṇā;	yatas kira bho ayam attā kāyassa bhedā param maraṇā ucchijjati vinassati na hoti param maraṇā 	4	‘When this self, with the breakup of the body, after death, is cut off, annihilated, does not exist after death,
['PA_iti_49:4.4']	etaṁ santaṁ etaṁ paṇītaṁ etaṁ yāthāvanti.	etam santam etam paṇītam etam yāthāvanti 	4	that is peaceful, that is excellent, that is just so.’
['PA_iti_49:4.5']	Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, atidhāvanti eke.	evam kho bhikkhave atidhāvanti eke 	4	That’s how some run too far.
['PA_iti_49:5.1']	Kathañca, bhikkhave, cakkhumanto passanti?	katham ca bhikkhave cakkhumantaḥ passanti 	5	“And how do those with eyes see?
['PA_iti_49:5.2']	Idha bhikkhu bhūtaṁ bhūtato passati;	idha bhikkhu bhūtam bhūtataḥ passati 	5	There is the case where a monk sees what has come to be as having come to be.
['PA_iti_49:5.3']	bhūtaṁ bhūtato disvā bhūtassa nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya paṭipanno hoti.	bhūtam bhūtataḥ disvā bhūtassa nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya paṭipannaḥ hoti 	5	Having seen what has come to be as having come to be, he practices for disenchantment with what has come to be, for dispassion toward what has come to be, for the cessation of what has come to be.
['PA_iti_49:5.4']	Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, cakkhumanto passantī”ti.	evam kho bhikkhave cakkhumanto passanti iti 	5	That’s how those with eyes see.”
['PA_iti_49:5.5']	Etamatthaṁ bhagavā avoca.	etam attham bhagavān avoca 	5	The Blessed One said this.
['PA_iti_49:5.6', 'PA_iti_49:6.1', 'PA_iti_49:6.2']	Tatthetaṁ iti vuccati:🔽“Ye bhūtaṁ bhūtato disvā,🔽bhūtassa ca atikkamaṁ;	tattha itam iti vuccati  ye bhūtam bhūtatas disvā  bhūtassa ca atikkama 	5	And in this regard, it was said:🔽“Having seen what has come to be as having come to be,
['PA_iti_49:6.3']	Yathābhūte vimuccanti,	yathābhūte vimuccanti 	6	and the transcending of what has come to be,

['PA_iti_49:7.4', 'PA_iti_49:8.1']	nāgacchati punabbhavan”ti.🔽Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti.	na āgacchati punar bhavanti  ayam pi atthaḥ vuttaḥ bhagavatā iti me sutam ti 	7	the monk does not come back to renewed existence.”
