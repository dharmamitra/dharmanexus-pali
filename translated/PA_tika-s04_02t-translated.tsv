That is why he said “therefore it is stated in their method” . The immaterial states should be regarded as included by the mention of the kasiṇas below . So their inclusion should be understood by the words “in these jhānas” . Since cessation and fading away are here intended as the same in meaning as the outlet, which is the purpose of the jhānas, it is said: “This method applies also to the passages dealing with fading away and cessation” . That is why he said: “For fading away, etc., are only another way of expressing outlet” . The word “renunciation” has the meaning of giving up and the meaning of falling away . So the twofold nature of renunciation is stated. For renunciation is giving up and falling away, in the sense of non-existence, through the state of having been destroyed.
